The advantage is that the X agents respond quickly. They will advise you on the way forward.</p><h2>How long does it take to reverse a Co-operative Bank transaction?</h2><p class=align-left>The Co-operative Bank's transaction reversal time can vary depending on the <a href=#>type of transaction</a>. The reversal can take around 24 hours to three days for debit card refunds, especially with most banks' faster payment systems.</p><p class=align-left>For wire transfers, the reversal process is more complex. If the transfer goes through and it was an error from the bank, they can initiate a reversal. But if the sender provides incorrect information, the chances of reversal are meagre.</p><h2>Why it may take longer to reverse a Co-operative Bank transaction</h2><p class=align-left>Many situations arise where you may get your money immediately. For example, if you send the money to an M-PESA number, call the recipient and ask them to reverse the money to your account.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7aa323423e47b7dc.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to withdraw money from Till Number to your M-Pesa account</span></p></a><p class=align-left>You might get your money back immediately if they agree. However, the following situations may make it difficult for you:</p><h3>Money sent to a merchant’s account</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8850d26fbde22cad.png><p class=align-left>The problem comes if the money is accidentally sent to a merchant’s account. Here is what happens:</p><ul><li>You contact the bank to ask them to reverse money sent to the wrong merchant’s number.</li><li>The bank gets your details and the transaction information but does not reverse the money immediately.</li><li>Instead, the bank contacts the merchant to ask them about the transaction.</li><li>At this point, you and the bank are at the mercy of the merchant.</li><li>The merchant must agree that the money was erroneously sent to their account.</li><li>If the merchant agrees to have the money reversed, it will be reversed. But if they do not agree, the bank will not reverse the money.</li></ul><h3>Money is sent to an account with multiple signatories</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a2d621dc33c0afff.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Koko Till Number: How to purchase fuel through mobile money</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The entire step becomes even more challenging if the money goes to an account with multiple signatories. When that happens, your <a href=#>bank branch </a>must contact all the signatories of the receiving account to confirm the transaction and content of the reversal. That may take days to complete.</p><h3>Recipient fails to respond to a reversal request</h3><p class=align-left>Sometimes, the merchant or recipient may not respond. For example, in 2021, a user tried to reverse money he sent to a wrong number. He contacted Co-operative Bank through several channels, including social media.</p><p class=align-left>The bank took all the steps to reverse the money, including contacting the merchant. Unfortunately, the merchant never replied. As a result, it took more than a month to get a reply.</p><h3>Recipient withdrew the money</h3><p class=align-left>It may take longer to receive your money even when the person agreed to have received the amount erroneously. That can happen if the person withdraws the money.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f6e587e9a31eeab7.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What is ho/store number in M-Pesa when applying for a Business Till?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In that case, they must fund the account to allow the bank to reverse the money. You cannot tell how long it will take to fund the account.</p><p class=align-left>If the merchant or recipient refuses to have your money reversed, report to the authorities to have your money reversed. The authorities will use Section 35 of The Computer Misuse and Cybercrimes Act, 2018, to file a case against the Merchant or recipient.</p><h2>How to avoid sending money to the wrong number</h2><p class=align-left>You can avoid sending money to the wrong number or account number by doing the following:</p><ul><li>Double-check the recipient's information before sending the payment. Always verify the recipient's phone number or account number before sending the payment.</li><li>Use payment from the Co-operative Bank’s mobile app to transact. The app gives you the recipient's details before approving the transaction.</li><li>You can also add users you send money frequently to your favourites list. That will allow you to tap on their numbers through the app, send them the money, and avoid guesswork.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c4dba3a2618b4237.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to increase M-Pesa commission If you are an M-Pesa agent</span></p></a><h2>Wrapping up</h2><p class=align-left>Do you know how to reverse a Co-operative Bank transaction sent to the wrong number or account?
