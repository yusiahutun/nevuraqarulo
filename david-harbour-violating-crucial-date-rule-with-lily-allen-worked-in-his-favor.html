However, the Stranger Things star actually broke a vital date rule, which we’re glad to know didn’t ruin his chances with the singer.</strong></p><p>David Harbour and Lily Allen’s somewhat normal meeting eventually led to walking down the aisle. The <a href=#>celebrity</a> couple recently celebrated three years of blissful marriage. In adorable photos they shared on <a href=#>Instagram</a>, the duo have clearly enjoyed every second of it so far. But, the <a href=#>movie</a> star did admit how their third date played out – and what should have been a red flag didn’t appear to alarm Lily.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-david-harbour-and-lily-allen-meet-on-dating-app>David Harbour and Lily Allen meet on dating app</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/GettyImages-1478182767-621x1024.jpg><p>Can it get any more 21st century than that? It’s hard to believe that <a href=#>Hollywood</a> stars look for love through swiping, but it turns out they do. They’re just like us.</p><p>When <a href=#>music</a> star Lily spoke about their connection on The Jonathan Ross Show, she divulged all to the chat show host. She revealed the pair began talking on Raya, the exclusive dating app. It’s only for celebrities, big stars and anyone else who can pass the membership process. In some cases, stars have to be recommended or vouched for by a fellow celeb – so don’t try to download it, as you may be rejected.</p><p>Funnily enough, Lily admitted she didn’t even know who David was – but she saw his profile and liked it.</p><p>She explained: “I thought he was just like a sexy policeman from a reality TV show because he was wearing a policeman’s uniform. It was a still from Stranger Things. I’d never seen Stranger Things.”</p><p>Not only that, but the F You hitmaker said she was just swiping idly on holiday, for “a bit of fun”.</p><p>He was in town filming Black Widow, and Lily feared it “wasn’t going to go anywhere”. Likely because the <a href=#>TV</a> star would head back to the US when filming wrapped up. But it did go somewhere.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-david-s-date-mistake>David’s date mistake</h2><p>Recalling the early days of the blossoming romance after the first meet between David Harbour and Lily Allen, he spoke about how he thought she was “unbelievable”. They instantly hit it off, but he may have overshared on his third date – which some <a href=# rel=nofollow>dating experts</a> suggest to hold off before doing so.</p><p>He was explaining that he was in an odd phase but went with the vibe.</p><p>He <a href=# rel=nofollow>told</a> People: “I was just in this phase where I was like, ‘I’m just going to be brutally honest about everything,’ because why lie? And I told her something about my life, about my beliefs.</p><p>“It would take a really extraordinary person to be accepting of the things that I said.</p><p>“And I remember thinking:&nbsp;Wow, that’s somebody I want to be around.”</p><p>David didn’t explain what things he said, which would need someone “extraordinary” to accept. However, we’re glad that person turned out to be Lily.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-just-like-titanic>‘Just like Titanic’</h2><p>What is more adorable is how Lily explained what she felt when she first set eyes on him. She said attraction was “pretty instant” between the pair.</p><p>The mom-of-two said: “He was sitting underneath a clock. It was a bit like that moment in <a href=#>Titanic</a>, where [Jack] turns around under the clock.”</p><p>The couple opted for a Las Vegas wedding, with her two daughters being present. But why did he feel it was time to get hitched? David explained during a family bike ride with the foursome, Lily’s youngest daughter tripped up on what to call him. Feeling confused on naming him ‘David’, ‘Dad’, or something else, the actor wanted to marry Lily “because of the emotional fallout”.</p><p>In September 2020 they tied the knot in the casino hotspot, with an <a href=#>Elvis Presley</a> impersonator officiating the special moment. They then enjoyed burgers and fries from a fast food chain for the reception.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlxX2WFcLDAr6CdZZiWv6O71Ktkr6Gfoa61tc2gZJyqpZi2oriMnZitnV2nwq2xjLCgraBdobatxYyao6WdnmLEsL7KnptmoZ5itaq%2FjJ%2BYr6eiZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kansas-city-chiefs-fans-everything-we-know-so-far.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Everything We Know So Far About Mysterious Deaths</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./adam-levine-family-man-bike-ride-two-daughters-montecito-following-sexting-scandal-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Adam Levine a family man on a bike ride with two daughters in Montecito following sexting scandal</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./french-montanas-solid-wallet-explains-why-he-aint-worried-bout-nothin.html>French Montanas solid wallet explains why he Aint Worried Bout Nothin Tue 5 July 2022</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-jackson-new-album-songs-for-mother-daughters.html>Alan Jackson's New Album Features Songs for His Late Mother, More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-f1cf0f18-55b5-552e-a3b7-517c726ba35c-html.html>Eagles C Jason Kelce retires after 13 seasons | National</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65b82c73268e3ecb698b458b-html.html>Resultados Progol 2213: premios y quiniela ganadora del fin de semana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-cbd-products.html>What Is It, Is It Legal, And Will It Get You High?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib.
