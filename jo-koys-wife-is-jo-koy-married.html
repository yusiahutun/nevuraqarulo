Was She Jo Koy’s Wife?&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jo Koy’s former wife was born on May 28, 1979. Her father was an American named David A. King, while her mother was a Filipino named Tessie King.&nbsp;</p><p>Her father has English ancestry, but her mother hails from the Philippines. The World War II vet had moved to the Asian country following his retirement, and it was during that period he met and fell in love with Tessie.&nbsp;</p><p>They did not take long to welcome their daughter Angie, after which they moved to the US. King’s parents raised her alongside her siblings in California as Catholics. However, her mother ensured they did not forsake their Filipino heritage.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/angkin.jpg><p>Right from when they were kids, King’s mother instilled Filipino tradition. It helped King better bond with her heritage, which she proudly shows off today.</p><p>Unfortunately, King has now lost one of her parents. Her dad, David, passed on in 2018, ending 40 years of blissful union with his wife Tessie.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Angie_King_Siblings></span>Angie King Siblings<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Angie King’s parents welcomed another child after her. It was a boy they named David King Jr.&nbsp;Reports claim that David and Angie share a close bond. Her social media feed proves how well they get along, as it contains many pictures of David.&nbsp;</p><p>David is now married and is a father as well. He and his girlfriend of many years, Janea, tied the knot and have welcomed a daughter named Natalie Rose King. She was born in February 2019, and her birth launched King over the moon.&nbsp;</p><p>She took to social media to express her joy at the good news by sharing a picture with her niece.&nbsp;Aside from her biological brother, Angie King has three half-siblings: two sisters, Cindi King Tuning and Danielle Bush, and one brother, Michael King.&nbsp;</p><p>Very little information is available about the three as King rarely shares posts about them on her social media. However, some reports claim they all get along well.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Does_the_Lady_Who_Used_to_Be_Jo_Koys_Wife_Do></span>What Does the Lady Who Used to Be Jo Koy’s Wife Do?&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Angie King is a singer and songwriter, but she was not always bent on making a career in the music industry. According to some sources, King was persuaded to begin a career in music in the US by her late father, a professional opera singer.</p><p>Her <a href=#>website</a> states: “Her late beloved father was a professional opera singer who heavily influenced her eclectic sound. Reminiscent of her childhood and in the church choir, her dark and dreamy melodies convey a time of romance, mystery, and illusion to interpret the blank narrative. It’s an emotion. It’s seen as an art.”</p><p>King is now more popular and recognized by her stage name, Nura Luca. The artist released her first single in 2019, and she talked about it on her Instagram.&nbsp;</p><p>She said the song is “About love and self-awareness, which has an empowering reminder to ourselves that sometimes the love that we give away can quickly be taken for granted when we are blinded.”</p><p>She released her album “Pipe Dreams” in 2020 and a single called “Mediatrix!” later that year.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/koy.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=When_Did_Angie_King_Stop_Being_Jo_Koys_Wife></span>When Did Angie King Stop Being Jo Koy’s Wife?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Angie King stopped being Jo Koy’s wife in 2013. The pair started dating while Jo Koy was coming up as a comedian.&nbsp;</p><p>They married in February 2003 in an intimate ceremony witnessed by several friends and family. The pair supported each other while they were together, but their relationship was not scheduled for longevity, and they divorced after a decade in 2013.</p><p>They welcomed one child named Joseph Herbert Jr. while together and have remained on good terms after the split.&nbsp;</p><p>Jo Koy called her his “best friend” when he appeared on “The Jennifer Hudson Show” and even revealed to <a href=#>Jennifer Hudson</a> that he bought her a house right in front of his own.</p><p>This shows how much he still cares about her.
