This project is really simple, even for beginners. Hold onto your Santa hats; it's about to be a bumpy ride.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=step-one-the-logistics>Step One: The Logistics</h2><p>If you're going to go through all of the trouble of creating a Christmas card in Photoshop, the chances are you'll want to eventually print and send it.</p><p>If your home printer can't handle nice card stock, you might want to look into third-party printing services. There are many online, but your local photo store or Walmart should also have you covered.</p><p>Secondly: what is your vision for this Christmas card? Photoshop can create a double-sided postcard, a Christmas flyer, or anything else that you can think of. We're going traditional: a classic fold-out Christmas card.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/how-to-make-a-christmas-card-in-photoshop.png><p>Once you've decided for yourself, open up Photoshop and create a new 6" by 4" document. Use <strong>Ctrl</strong> + <strong>R</strong> to enable your rulers, and pull one vertical guide out from the left. It should snap to the center of your document.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/how-to-create-a-christmas-card-in-photoshop.png><p>For your convenience, we have labelled the front and the back of the card. We're <a href=#>printing a double-sided document</a>, and will need another 6" by 4" document for the inside—but we'll get to that in a moment.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=step-two-placing-your-image>Step Two: Placing Your Image</h2><p>Now, it's time to add the image you want to use for the card. We're going to position it so that you only see my face on the front. You can copy and paste your desired image or drag it in from another Photoshop document or from your file directory.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/photoshop-christmas-cards.png><p>For this walkthrough, we'll be using this selfie that I took after giving myself the CocoMelon haircut of a lifetime. For your Christmas card, you'll likely want to opt for a photo of your family—or something sentimental like that.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=step-three-adding-a-border>Step Three: Adding a Border</h2><p>Right now, this card is looking less-than-festive. Let's add a nice red border, perfectly in-tune with this mounting sense of holiday spirit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/creating-a-christmas-card-in-photoshop.png><p>Hit <strong>M</strong> to enable the <strong>Marquee</strong> tool. Select the front half of the card, using your guide to get a nice, crisp edge.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/christmas-card-photoshop.png><p>Once you have the front of the card selected, navigate into the <strong>Select</strong> dropdown, choosing <strong>Modify</strong>, and then <strong>Contract</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/creating-christmas-cards-in-photoshop.png><p>Make sure that <strong>Apply effect at canvas bounds</strong> is checked. Your border can be as thick or as scant as you want; we're going to go with 50 pixels.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/how-to-make-a-christmas-card-on-photoshop.png><p>Right now, we have the interior of the frame selected—what we actually want to select is the exterior. Right-click on your selection. From the dropdown, choose <strong>Select Inverse</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/how-to-make-christmas-cards-in-photoshop.png><p>You should have marching ants all over the front of the card, delineating your selection. To fill it, we'll need to choose an appropriately Christmas-y hue.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/how-to-make-christmas-card-in-photoshop.png><p>With the color picker, find a nice red, green, or gold, whatever you're feeling.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/how-to-make-a-christmas-card.png><p>Once you've got a color chosen, select <strong>Fill</strong> from the <strong>Edit</strong> menu above.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/how-to-create-a-christmas-card.png><p>Make sure that <strong>Contents</strong> is set to <strong>Foreground Color</strong>. Once everything is in order, press <strong>OK</strong>. This function should flood the entirety of your selected area with the color that you chose.</p><h2 id=step-four-adding-the-text>Step Four: Adding the Text</h2><p>Now, your Christmas card should be starting to look a little bit more like a Christmas card. The front is definitely missing something, however: a heartwarming seasonal message for your guests to revel in.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How to Add and Edit Text in Adobe Photoshop</a></span></p><p>Hitting the <strong>T</strong> key calls up the <strong>Horizontal Type</strong> tool. You can also type your message vertically or along a path if you prefer.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/diy-christmas-card-1.png><p>What's the best part about Photoshop Christmas cards? You can festoon it with whatever you want. Simply type your message in, no holds barred. By selecting the <strong>Move</strong> tool with the <strong>V</strong> key, you can reposition the title of your Christmas card as necessary.</p><p>Feel free to play around with things like font and text weight here. The possibilities are truly endless, and your friends and family deserve nothing but the finest that you have to offer.</p><h2 id=step-five-adding-snowflakes>Step Five: Adding Snowflakes</h2><p>To really drive home this Christmas theme, we're going to need some third-party assistance. If you've never experimented with importing Photoshop brushes before, now is the time. They make projects like this so much more fun.</p><p>Custom Photoshop brushes come in every form imaginable online; we downloaded this set from <a href=#>Brusheezy</a> user hawksmont. In it, you'll find a smörgåsbord of high-quality snowflake brushes. If none of those float your boat, though, we've got plenty of other <a href=#>festive Photoshop effects</a> to share.</p><p>To begin with these Photoshop brushes, download the .ZIP file and unzip its contents. Head back into Photoshop to import them through the <strong>Brush</strong> toolbar.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/creating-christmas-cards.png><p>If your Brush tool isn't selected, hit the icon on the left or press the <strong>B</strong> key. Click into the thumbnail image of the brush that is currently enabled from the toolbar above. Under the <strong>Gear</strong> dropdown, choose <strong>Import Brushes</strong>.</p><p>Navigate to where you have your brushes stored and select the ABR file to pull them into Photoshop. They should now be loaded in at the bottom of your default brush options; scroll down through them until you reach the newest folder below.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/how-to-make-a-christmas-card-photoshop.png><p>Perfect. Now, onto the most important part: what's on the inside.</p><h2 id=step-six-finishing-the-card>Step Six: Finishing the Card</h2><p>If you're creating a Hallmark-style card, you've probably already got some ideas about what you want the inside of this fold-out to say. Create a second 4" by 6" Photoshop file, marking the middle with another vertical guide.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/how-to-make-christmas-card.png><p>Using the <strong>Type</strong> tool again, add your desired message. You can personalize a different note for each recipient or even add more images to the inside if you want.</p><p>When the card is finally complete, it's time to get it printed. You'll want to get your ducks in a row well in advance in order to give the cards time to reach each destination before the big day arrives. Save your work and send it off to the printers, if delivering your files digitally. If you're going with Staples, Target, CVS, or Walgreens, you can bring your files in on a thumb drive or something similar.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Once you've got the physical, printed cards in your arms, the rest is easy. Stick 'em in their envelopes, lick the stamps, and send them away.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Most Affordable Sites for Printing Documents Online</a></span></p><h2 id=the-ultimate-custom-christmas-card-photoshop-wizards-this-one-is-for-you>The Ultimate Custom Christmas Card: Photoshop Wizards, This One Is for You</h2><p>Creating your own Christmas card is a lot of fun; it's an excellent way to connect with friends and family that you might not see very often. Whether you choose a family photo, a picture of your dog, or just a funny message, it'll make a cute keepsake that they'll be able to hang on their fridges or corkboards.</p><p>If you have kids, this will definitely be a treat that Grandma keeps in her wallet. Your yearly family portrait is going to be making the rounds as she checks out from the grocery store, and everybody behind her in line will have only you to thank for it. Mission accomplished.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGirmp9foq6ssYycn6uho6m6or%2BMnJirnF2ltbDAzqyfqKhf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./149251.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Samantha Sklar Promoted To Vice President Of A&amp;amp;R At Position Music</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ghost-in-the-shell-scarlett-johansson-the-post-human-star-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How Scarlett Johansson Became Our Finest Post-Human Movie Star</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./french-montanas-solid-wallet-explains-why-he-aint-worried-bout-nothin.html>French Montanas solid wallet explains why he Aint Worried Bout Nothin Tue 5 July 2022</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-jackson-new-album-songs-for-mother-daughters.html>Alan Jackson's New Album Features Songs for His Late Mother, More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-f1cf0f18-55b5-552e-a3b7-517c726ba35c-html.html>Eagles C Jason Kelce retires after 13 seasons | National</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65b82c73268e3ecb698b458b-html.html>Resultados Progol 2213: premios y quiniela ganadora del fin de semana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-cbd-products.html>What Is It, Is It Legal, And Will It Get You High?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib.
