The<a href=#> A Star Is Born</a> actor met his spouse after getting his start in the film industry.</p><h2>Who Is Katharine Ross?</h2><p>Like Sam, Katharine is an <a href=#>Academy Award</a> nominee who has made quite a name for herself in Hollywood. She made her film debut in 1965’s Shenandoah and subsequently appeared in The Singing Nun, The Graduate, The Stepford Wives, Fools and more. She was married four times before her relationship with Sam.</p><p>In 1969, both Katharine and Sam appeared in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. At the time, she was married to her third husband, Conrad Hall. It wasn’t until years later that the two performers crossed paths again.</p><p>“I didn’t dare try to talk to her then. She was the leading lady. I was a shadow on the wall, a glorified extra in a bar scene,” Sam told <a href=#>AARP</a> in July 2015 of meeting his now-wife for the first time. “It wasn’t until we made The Legacy [in 1978] that we actually interacted. We have a common sensibility, but we also work at being together. You work past the s–t; you don’t walk away from it. That’s how relationships last.”</p><p>While making The Legacy, Katharine was married to her fourth husband, Gaetano Lisi. After their divorce in 1979, she moved on with Sam and they gave their love a real shot. The 1883 actor and the Home Before Dark actress got married in 1984.</p><p>Years after walking down the aisle, Sam revealed the secret to his lasting marriage.</p><p>“I think really what it boils down to is we love each other, and we work at it,” he told NPR in June 2017. “And I think more importantly than anything, it takes wanting to be married. The two things that I wanted in my life were to have a movie career and to be married, to have a family. And it’s an embarrassment of riches that I’ve got both.”</p><p>In 2017, the longtime lovebirds shared the screen again in The Hero, where they played a divorced couple.</p><p>“I think we just like making movies and having that creative experience together is the best,” Sam told The Los Angeles Times in November 2016. “It’s just fun. It’s a whole different kind of energy to go home with someone you’re working with rather than go home to somebody who isn’t working. It’s a totally positive experience.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Who-Is-Sam-Elliott-Married-To-Meet-His-Wife-Katharine-Ross-.jpg><h2><strong>Do Sam Elliott and Katharine Ross Have Any Kids?</strong></h2><p>A few months after tying the knot, Sam and Katharine welcomed their first child together, daughter <strong>Cleo Rose Elliott</strong>, on September 17, 1984. Their only child is a musician and vocalist for the Uncle Becky Band. Cleo is thankful to have had her parents in her corner from the very beginning of her music career.</p><p>“My parents are totally supportive of this,” she told The Malibu Times in December 2008. “They’re just happy I don’t want to be an actor.”</p><p>Cleo has also accompanied her parents to several red carpet events over the years, including the 2013 Creative Arts Emmy Awards, the 2018 premiere of A Star Is Born in Los Angeles and the 91st Annual Academy Awards in 2019.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46wn6hlmah6tK3MZpylpJmkwbV5zJqpq6GVmXq1u4ymnJ6sXZ22tHnWop2eZZuWwamt0aKlnmWipMC0ew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./482282-20-knotless-braids-curly-ends-a-stunning-look.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>20 best knotless braids with curly ends for a stunning look</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ap-to-ohtanis-surgeon-a-103-mph-fastball-was-a-red-flag-but-his-700m-deal-shows-trust-in-tj-surgery.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>To Ohtanis surgeon, a 103 mph fastball was a red flag, but his $700M deal shows trust in TJ surge</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./french-montanas-solid-wallet-explains-why-he-aint-worried-bout-nothin.html>French Montanas solid wallet explains why he Aint Worried Bout Nothin Tue 5 July 2022</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-jackson-new-album-songs-for-mother-daughters.html>Alan Jackson's New Album Features Songs for His Late Mother, More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-f1cf0f18-55b5-552e-a3b7-517c726ba35c-html.html>Eagles C Jason Kelce retires after 13 seasons | National</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65b82c73268e3ecb698b458b-html.html>Resultados Progol 2213: premios y quiniela ganadora del fin de semana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-cbd-products.html>What Is It, Is It Legal, And Will It Get You High?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib.
