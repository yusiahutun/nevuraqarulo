When your girlfriend is criticising you all the time, these may be the reasons:</p><ul><li>She addresses her concerns in a way that suggests she is finding fault with you.</li><li>She learned to communicate critically as a child or in other relationships.</li><li>She may have tried lodging complaints before, and it is not helping.</li><li>She may be afraid to trust her judgment in the relationship.</li><li>She may be traumatised from past experiences.</li><li>She feels insecure or inadequate.</li><li>She is projecting her issues onto you.</li><li>She may be trying to control you or the relationship.</li><li>She may be unhappy with herself or the relationship and is taking it out on you.</li><li>In other cases, she may not be aware of how her behaviour is affecting you and the relationship.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9b1b8a636b616304.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Signs of unspoken attraction between coworkers to notice</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/221ab161495df6bb.png><h2>How to handle the negativity in a relationship</h2><p class=align-left>Whenever your girlfriend takes everything you say the wrong way, try to figure out how to handle the negativity. While it is not easy, here is what you can do to stabilise the situation:</p><h3>1. Improve communication</h3><p class=align-left>Improving communication in a relationship can be challenging. Nevertheless, talk to your girlfriend about how her negativity affects you and your relationship. Admit you are not connecting as before, and talk with her about rekindling your connection.</p><h3>2. Listen to her</h3><p class=align-left>When your girlfriend is negative, try listening to her perspective and understand where she is coming from. Listening to your girlfriend can help you build trust and intimacy. It also avoids <a href=#>misunderstandings and conflicts</a>.</p><h3>3. Be patient with her</h3><p class=align-left>If the negativity started recently, being patient with your girlfriend is best. It may take time for her to change her behaviour. But being patient shows her that you value her and your relationship enough to see beyond her faults.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/179a71272e2b2899.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ save the date quotes for a wedding: Best, funny, and cute ideas</span></p></a><h3>4. Do not take it personally</h3><p class=align-left>When your girlfriend is negative about you, it can be easy to take it personally and feel hurt or defensive. However, remember that her negativity is likely not about you. Instead, it may be a reflection of her issues and struggles.</p><h3>5. Focus on the positive</h3><p class=align-left>Getting caught up in your girlfriend’s <a href=#>negative emotions </a>and thoughts is easy. However, focus on staying calm. Positivity will help you approach the situation with empathy and understanding. As a result, you will work together to find solutions.</p><h3>6. Set boundaries</h3><p class=align-left>Always set boundaries whenever your girlfriend constantly puts you down. Setting boundaries helps to protect your emotional well-being. It also helps you avoid being taken advantage of or mistreated by your girlfriend.</p><h3>7. Do not engage in arguments</h3><p class=align-left>Arguments are unnecessary and unproductive when your relationship is in turmoil. When you engage in an argument, it only&nbsp;escalates the situation. Finding a solution will become impossible.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f7e69dadcf886282.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to impress a girl on Instagram chat (with examples)</span></p></a><h3>8. Be supportive</h3><p class=align-left>Despite the negativity, showing your girlfriend that you support and care about her is always healthy. Being supportive shows your girlfriend you care about her and value your relationship. That may go a long way in strengthening your bond.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9b1b8a636b616304.jpg><h3>9. Encourage her to seek help</h3><p class=align-left>Your girlfriend’s negativity may be due to deeper issues unknown to you. And since you want to<a href=#> stabilise your relationship</a>, it is best to encourage her to seek professional help. Professional help can give her the tools and resources to manage her negative thoughts and feelings.</p><h3>10. Do not try to fix her</h3><p class=align-left>You cannot change a grownup, and your girlfriend is no exception. When you try to fix her, she will interpret the action as controlling or dismissive of her feelings. In the end, she will feel frustrated and resentful. It will also prevent her from taking responsibility for her actions.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a239dc286ab513a6.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 powerful prayers to mend what is broken in your life</span></p></a><h3>11. Validate her feelings</h3><p class=align-left>Validating your girlfriend's feelings makes her feel understood and accepted. As a result, it can improve her mood and outlook. It will also make it easier for you to communicate your love and commitment to her, even in difficult times.</p><h3>12. Do not dismiss her feelings</h3><p class=align-left>It is a bad idea to dismiss your girlfriend’s feelings when she is negative about you. She will feel invalidated and unimportant, damaging her self-esteem and your relationship. It can also lead to misunderstandings and conflict in your relationship.</p><h3>13. Do not bring up the past</h3><p class=align-left>Always avoid bringing up past issues when there is conflict in your relationship. Bringing up the past is unproductive and harmful and will only worsen things. The past will not help you find solutions to your current situation.</p><h3>14. Work on yourself</h3><p class=align-left>Your girlfriend may be negative because of you. Instead of blaming everything on her, improve yourself and your behaviour. When you work on yourself, you will develop healthy coping mechanisms, confidence, and self-esteem.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/bfb52626ba1beb41.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to make your angry girlfriend happy over text in 10 ways</span></p></a><h3>15. Consider ending the relationship</h3><p class=align-left>Your girlfriend’s negativity may reach a point where you feel it is too much to handle. You may have done everything to improve things, but she is unwilling to change.</p><p class=align-left>When it reaches this point, consider ending the relationship. Too much negativity is emotionally draining and takes a toll on your well-being. Ending the relationship will give you the space and time to focus on yourself.</p><h2>Final word</h2><p class=align-left>"My girlfriend always finds faults in me. What should I do?" Try different things to bring positivity to the relationship. Work on yourself, be honest with yourself and your girlfriend, and do not try to change her. But if it becomes too much, consider ending the relationship.</p><p class=align-left>Tuko.co.ke shared an interesting article about <a href=#>how guys feel</a> when they see their ex looking good. Ending a relationship is always a challenging experience, often leaving people feeling bitter and angry.</p><p class=align-left>You can never predict when you might unexpectedly encounter your former partner. When a man encounters his former partner, and they appear more appealing after the breakup, his emotions are influenced by the authenticity of his love for his ex.</p><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnCywJyrrGWcnrOmtMCcoqxnl6q2pbHSaGxrbGlng2652Gaeoqqcm7%2Bqsc2dZJ%2BhnpnAbrLArqOtq12dvLh5x5qlnaSVYrums8CtoK%2BhpK58</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./elizabeth-von-der-goltz-interview-net-a-porter.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Net-a-Porter's global buying director shares her top packing tips Elizabeth von der Goltz interv</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./morgan-wallen-spin-you-around-new-stand-alone-album.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Morgan Wallen Slams New Record, Drops Spin You Around Re-Make</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./french-montanas-solid-wallet-explains-why-he-aint-worried-bout-nothin.html>French Montanas solid wallet explains why he Aint Worried Bout Nothin Tue 5 July 2022</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-jackson-new-album-songs-for-mother-daughters.html>Alan Jackson's New Album Features Songs for His Late Mother, More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-f1cf0f18-55b5-552e-a3b7-517c726ba35c-html.html>Eagles C Jason Kelce retires after 13 seasons | National</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65b82c73268e3ecb698b458b-html.html>Resultados Progol 2213: premios y quiniela ganadora del fin de semana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-cbd-products.html>What Is It, Is It Legal, And Will It Get You High?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib.
