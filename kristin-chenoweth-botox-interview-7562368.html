She wants to talk Scandoval (“Are they still together, Sandoval and Rachel?”), her favorite new skincare products, and Botox.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Yes, she loves that use of Botox, but she’s partnered with the brand to talk about how it’s helped her manage her chronic migraines, too. After struggling with often debilitating symptoms throughout her 20s and 30s, she started doing regular treatments to prevent migraine attacks. “I thought I was going to have to retire — the spotlight, the flashing lights of the lights from cameras, paparazzi — all of that was causing me to really melt,” she tells InStyle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Chenoweth’s first migraine attack happened mid-performance with the Virginia Symphony at 25. And like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>other famous women with migraines</a>, Chenoweth says her motto was always to push through. “Those of us who do what we do at a high level, we’ve been taught — right or wrong — you go on. Sick, injured, trauma — you go on. And sometimes you can’t.” Now that she’s finally found a treatment for her migraines (for her, that’s Botox every 12 weeks), she’s no longer “living in fear.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She’s also in tune with other migraine triggers like her menstrual cycle, the weather, her diet, flying, and stress. “I’m learning from the younger generation about self-care,” says Chenoweth. “I cut out alcohol, went on a low-sodium diet, and I drink crazy amounts of water with electrolytes which also helps my throat with singing. And I’m trying to sleep better — it’s not going very well! I have trouble turning off my brain,” she adds. “Meditation has become big for me in the past year. I was one of those people that never stopped. I still don’t stop, but I do make time for meditation.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Right now, the long list of projects keeping her booked and busy include season 3 of Apple TV’s Schmigadoon!, her concert tour, working on an album, and preparing for her upcoming Broadway musical, Queen of Versailles, based on the 2012 documentary about socialite Jacqueline Siegel. “I’m one of the producers as well, so that’s exciting to be starring in a show where I’m invited to the table that way,” she says.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And while Chenoweth is coy about confirming or denying a cameo in the upcoming Wicked movie adaptation, she’s been <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>mentoring Ariana Grande</a> as she prepares to step into Chenoweth’s role as Glinda. “I’ve known Ari since she was 10, so it’s a full-circle moment for us both,” she says. (She’s also <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>raved about Grande’s lip oil from r.e.m. Beauty</a>&nbsp;helping it to sell out five times, so clearly, Chenoweth is a good friend to have in your corner.)&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Plus, she and her fiancé Josh Bryant are in the process of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>planning their wedding</a>. As for how she’s changing her beauty routine in preparation, Chenoweth says she prefers a less-is-more approach whenever possible, especially before any big event. “I try to give my face a break. When I’m not working, I don’t put makeup on. Chapstick and an eyelash curler can go a long way,” she says.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for her anti-aging skincare recommendations, Chenoweth has a few key products in her arsenal. “I’m very simple. I’ve tried everything fancy, and I love the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Augustinus Bader moisturizer</a>. It’s a splurge but really worth it&nbsp;— it keeps my face glowing, dewy, and moisturized,” she says. She’s also remained loyal to one of her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>favorite affordable drugstore products</a>: “I’m very much into Bio-Oil — I put it on my wrinkles, and I can tell the difference.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Like the rest of us, she’s also become curious recently about the world of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>clean beauty</a>. “I’m not a vegan, and I’m not vegetarian, but I’ve started looking at a lot of the chemicals [in my beauty products]. Right now, I've been trying a new brand called Pacifica, they’re a vegan brand, and I’m telling you, their <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>moisturizer</a>… I have some dark skin damage from being a kid in the sun, and it’s really, really working,” she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“My best beauty secret is — this is what Josh, my fiancé, always says to me, ‘When you laugh, you look 12!’” She adds,&nbsp;“It’s the simple things in life that work: Sleep, water, laughter, and a good moisturizer and call it a day.”<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57yqugrKyZo3qktMSnprCdpJ16o7vTqK9moZ6psrPCyJ6uZm9la390gpc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rosie-huntington-whiteley.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Rosie Huntington Whiteley: Latest News, Pictures &amp;amp; Videos</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./archive-the-chartist-meeting-in-london-1848.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>From the archive, 12 April 1848: The Chartist meeting in London | Politics past</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./french-montanas-solid-wallet-explains-why-he-aint-worried-bout-nothin.html>French Montanas solid wallet explains why he Aint Worried Bout Nothin Tue 5 July 2022</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-jackson-new-album-songs-for-mother-daughters.html>Alan Jackson's New Album Features Songs for His Late Mother, More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-f1cf0f18-55b5-552e-a3b7-517c726ba35c-html.html>Eagles C Jason Kelce retires after 13 seasons | National</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65b82c73268e3ecb698b458b-html.html>Resultados Progol 2213: premios y quiniela ganadora del fin de semana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-cbd-products.html>What Is It, Is It Legal, And Will It Get You High?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib.
