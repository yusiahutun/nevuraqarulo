Bogart was married to his third wife, actress Mayo Methot, at the time. Despite their 25-year age gap, sparks flew between the two stars, and their relationship progressed quickly. The movie debuted on Jan. 20, 1945, and Bogart was divorced soon after. He and Bacall tied the knot on May 21, 1945 at a ceremony on Pulitzer Prize-winning author Louis Bromfield's farm in Lucas, Ohio. They would go on to have two children together, staying married until Bogart's death in 1957.</p><img alt="Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall" title="Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall" width=4072 height=5160 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/clv.h-cdn.co/assets/17/32/1502485764-gettyimages-50611818.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1lk26yx e6iqukd2">Getty Images</span><p>Bogart and Bacall on their wedding day</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Bacall wasn't the least bit interested in her future husband the first time she saw him on screen in Casablanca. The friend she saw the movie with found him sexy.

He told jokes to make her feel more comfortable in front of the camera, and soon their working relationship became a flirtatious friendship. In her memoir Be Myself, Bacall recounted how, three weeks into filming, Bogart stopped by her trailer to say goodnight. She was brushing her hair, and he was standing behind her:</p><p class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0"><span data-redactor-tag=span data-verified=redactor></span>Suddenly he leaned over, put his hand under my chin, and kissed me. It was impulsive—he was a bit shy—no lunging wolf tactics. He took a worn package of matches out of his pocket and asked me to put my phone number on the back. I did. I don't know why I did, except it was kind of part of our game. Bogie was meticulous about not being too personal, was known for never fooling around with women at work or anywhere else. He was not that kind of man, and also he was married to a woman who was a notorious drinker and fighter. A tough lady who would hit you with an ashtray, lamp, anything, as soon as not.</p><img alt="Lauren Bacall and Humphrey Bogart" title="Lauren Bacall and Humphrey Bogart" width=3729 height=3027 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/clv.h-cdn.co/assets/17/32/1502487089-gettyimages-3226851.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1lk26yx e6iqukd2">Getty Images</span><p>Bacall and Bogart at home with their pet dog in 1945</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">When director Howard Hawks got wind of the affair, he tried to put a stop to it by telling Bacall it was just a fling, that Bogart would dump her once filming ended. He even threatened to ruin her career, bluffing that he would send her to the "lowest" studios in Hollywood. "[Hawks] used to say to Bogie, 'You don't have to get serious about this girl. Take her downtown to a hotel and get a room with her—that's enough.' That was not Bogie's scene at all," Bacall revealed decades later.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Her mother disliked her new boyfriend, too. When she came to visit Bacall, she mused out loud about what her daughter was thinking by pursuing a married man 25 years her senior who had a drinking problem, according to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/news/humphrey-bogart-lauren-bacall-love-story data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Biography.com class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">Biography.com</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Of course, no one successfully deterred the union. Bogart became a father for the first time at age 46 when the couple welcomed their firstborn, a son they name Stevie—presumably after Bogart's character Steve in To Have and Have Not—in January 1946.</p><img alt="Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, Stephen Bogart" title="Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, Stephen Bogart" width=2984 height=2184 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/clv.h-cdn.co/assets/17/32/1502488209-gettyimages-2636649.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1lk26yx e6iqukd2">Getty Images</span><p>Bacall and Bogart with Stevie, circa 1950</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Their daughter, Leslie, was born on August 23, 1952. Following the success of their first film together, credited in large part to their onscreen chemistry, the pair was cast in the film noir movie The Big Sleep almost immediately after. They also starred in Dark Passage (1947) and Key Largo (1948) together.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Though their relationship was marred by mutual infidelity—his with his longtime hairdresser Verita Peterson, and hers with Frank Sinatra—their mutual deep care for each other was evident until the end.</p><img alt="Photograph, People, Vintage clothing, Fashion, Retro style, Fun, Sitting, Family, " title="Photograph, People, Vintage clothing, Fashion, Retro style, Fun, Sitting, Family, " width=1006 height=1178 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/clv.h-cdn.co/assets/17/32/1502490135-screen-shot-2017-08-11-at-62146-pm.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1lk26yx e6iqukd2">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">"I never believed that I could love anyone again, for so many things have happened in my life to me that I was afraid to love," <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2726198/How-Bogie-seduced-LAUREN-BACALL-In-typically-forthright-memoirs-actress-died-week-tells-erotically-charged-story-epic-romance-Humphrey-Bogart.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Bogart wrote in a love letter" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">Bogart wrote in a love letter</a> to Bacall at the beginning of their relationship.

Bacall got engaged to Sinatra shortly after, but the relationship ended after she talked publicly about their affair against his wishes. She married actor Jason Robards in 1961, though it seems she never really got over Bogie.
