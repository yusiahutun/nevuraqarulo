But for designer Anna Sui, the&nbsp;words fit comfortably. “My parents&nbsp;were born in China, but they met in&nbsp;Paris, lived in Europe and then moved&nbsp;to the United &nbsp;States. I was born in the&nbsp;suburbs of Detroit and grew up on pop&nbsp;culture, television and rock ’n’ roll,”&nbsp;says the eclectic creative. “Am I American&nbsp;or Asian? I think of myself as a&nbsp;global person, which in essence we’re&nbsp;all becoming.”<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sitting in a flower-festooned suite&nbsp;at the Four Seasons Hong Kong, Sui&nbsp;was in the city to launch Fairy Dance,&nbsp;the last instalment in a trilogy of perfumes&nbsp;known as Secret Wish. Fairies&nbsp;make dreams come true, notes Sui.&nbsp;The launch represents yet another&nbsp;mini-milestone in what’s been one&nbsp;long and rewarding career of them.&nbsp;Sui, whose exuberant designs meld influences&nbsp;as disparate as Victorian&nbsp;cowboy, Andy Warhol and Finnish textile&nbsp;print, is among an elite to have received&nbsp;a Lifetime Achievement Award&nbsp;from the Council of Fashion Designers&nbsp;of America (CFDA), whose lofty company&nbsp;includes Yves Saint Laurent,&nbsp;Giorgio Armani, Ralph Lauren, and&nbsp;Diane von Furstenberg. Named one of&nbsp;the “Top 5 Fashion Icons of the Decade”&nbsp;[TIME], her eponymous brand has&nbsp;grown to become a global fashion industry&nbsp;worth an estimated US$400&nbsp;million by Forbes magazine. Comprising&nbsp;clothes, cosmetics, eyewear, and&nbsp;accessories, along with her line of sig-nature fragrances, Sui has more than 50 boutiques in eight countries and sells in over 300 stores in more than 30 countries.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Increasingly, and the irony is not&nbsp;lost on Sui, the potions have become&nbsp;brand enhancer and profit elixir. “Fragrance&nbsp;is the crown and glory of a design&nbsp;house,” she says. “It can reach&nbsp;further than &nbsp;your clothing and fashion. &nbsp;People now think of me as a perfume; it transcends a real person.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Like any prescient creative Sui’s wardrobe – worn by luminaries such as Sofia Coppola, Zooey Deschanel, and Kristen Stewart – is the result of a wild mind and disciplined eye; she’s equal parts fashion student and research shopaholic.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Her latest collection, inspired by illustrator and photographer Antonio Lopez, reflects that approach. “Lopez brought the excitement of New York fashion to Paris along with a bevy of models, and &nbsp;they invaded all of its nightclubs. He inspired people like Karl Lagerfeld and Yves Saint Laurent. Because of Lopez, prêt-à-porter was born and European designers wanted to do more immediate and younger fashion. There was vintage inspiration too. Women like Paloma Picasso and [model/actress] Marisa Berenson, wore things from the flea market. All these influences exploded at this great time – and that was my big inspiration.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hence the intricate homage to vintage prints and sepia-tones that infuse the collection. “I love the way fragrance creates mood – so can colour. I constantly look at photographs, paintings and film from whichever period is influencing me and try to capture that colour and put it on the catwalk.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Appropriating from her own palette, Sui’s collection also sees a return to flora and fauna with this collection. “For a few seasons I was trying not to do floral because people know me for it, but this season, it’s all floral.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Fascinated as she is by narrative and cultural history, Sui’s story is like a re-spun Cinderella of modern-day mythology in which the evil stepsisters make way for glamazonian supermodels. A graduate of New York’s Parsons School of Design, she styled with photographer friend Steven Meisel, designed for sportswear companies and then launched her brand in 1980, which grew during the decade. So impressed were catwalk queens Naomi Campbell and Linda Evangelista they encouraged – and then offered – to do Sui’s first runway show in 1991 for free.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sui, who still maintains contact with both, smiles at the recollections: “I don’t see them as often as before because they don’t do the shows. But I do see them. Naomi’s boyfriend has a place in New York so we get together for dinners. Linda lives in New York some of the time so I run into her every so often. We were pals. I knew them more as friends than as models and we fostered a great friendship over the years.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The show’s success saw&nbsp;Sui open her first store in&nbsp;1992 on Greene Street in New&nbsp;York’s Soho. With its vibrant&nbsp;mix of black Victorian furniture,&nbsp;purple walls, and rock ’n’ roll&nbsp;paraphernalia, it set the tone for all Anna Sui boutiques since.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Today’s face of&nbsp;Anna Sui fashion, cosmetics&nbsp;and perfume is&nbsp;Swedish sensation Frida&nbsp;Gustavsson, a dream fit&nbsp;for Sui.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Frida’s the type of&nbsp;model that only comes&nbsp;along every so often, she&nbsp;wears clothes beautifully&nbsp;and so gracefully and&nbsp;doesn’t have to be retouched.&nbsp;She’s perfect.”&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It’s hard to feel anything&nbsp;but joy and warmth for Sui in&nbsp;the face of her passion and enthusiasm. &nbsp;Fairy and godmother,&nbsp;fashion and dream, for&nbsp;one so grounded, she’s high&nbsp;fantastical.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Anna Sui’s Fairy Dance is the third instalment of perfumes under the title Secret Wish. “We wanted something that was light and fresh, the way the other fragrances were, but this one has an element of fruit: tangerine and mango,” she says, as a voluptuous bottle, topped with a fairy cap mists the air. “We wanted to evoke sunshine, when you see the juice itself, it has a sunny glow to it. We tried to capture a summer festival feeling with roses, and rose gardens and fairies, laughter and friendship.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">” The seemingly lofty aspirations are grounded in reality, as Sui explains: “There’s a festival I go to every summer in Cornwall, England, a long weekend where we celebrate life with music, literature and now there’s a fashion element going on there. And I thought, why not do something inspired by all of that? All in all, it’s about friendship. See in this whole theme, a fairy-tale element.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Fairies are the ones that can answer your dreams, which can make your wishes come true. So why not have the fairy as a symbol?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZMC1xcueZpqqpJ6wrbGOamdrbWVnfXC81KunpZ1dp7Kqs80%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./firefox-google-gears-problem.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Firefox &amp;amp; Google Gears Problem Chris Coyier</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./8-facts-about-architectural-landmarks-in-san-francisco-california.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>8 Facts About Architectural Landmarks In San Francisco, California</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./french-montanas-solid-wallet-explains-why-he-aint-worried-bout-nothin.html>French Montanas solid wallet explains why he Aint Worried Bout Nothin Tue 5 July 2022</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-jackson-new-album-songs-for-mother-daughters.html>Alan Jackson's New Album Features Songs for His Late Mother, More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-f1cf0f18-55b5-552e-a3b7-517c726ba35c-html.html>Eagles C Jason Kelce retires after 13 seasons | National</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65b82c73268e3ecb698b458b-html.html>Resultados Progol 2213: premios y quiniela ganadora del fin de semana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-cbd-products.html>What Is It, Is It Legal, And Will It Get You High?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib.
