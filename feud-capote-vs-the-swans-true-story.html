Of Capote’s ability to bring together icons from a multitude of industries, a source told the Times: “Truman created this new class of talented, good-natured, funny people, and that lasted for quite a long time.” His popularity would not last forever, however.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While In Cold Blood cemented Capote as a literary talent, his work on the unfinished Answered Prayers would lead to the conflict on which the second season of Feud is based.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Capote spilled too many secrets</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In 1975, Capote published his short story <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://classic.esquire.com/article/1975/11/1/la-cote-basque data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="“La Côte Basque 1965,”" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">“La Côte Basque 1965,”</a> an excerpt from his long-awaited follow-up to In Cold Blood, in Esquire. At the time, he had long since missed the original 1968 deadline he’d been given by publisher Random House, which, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.townandcountrymag.com/society/money-and-power/a36740693/truman-capote-la-cote-basque-scandal-answered-prayers-mystery/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Town & Country" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Town & Country</a> says, had paid him a $25,000 advance for Answered Prayers. “La Côte Basque 1965” immediately sparked controversy, as its characters bore a bit too much of a resemblance to some of Capote’s closest friends, whose indiscretions were detailed in the text. The story takes place in a high-end restaurant and sees a socialite share a slew of sordid gossip—much of which was very much grounded in reality—with her companion.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Swans were reportedly outraged that Capote would mine their lives for his work. As for Capote’s reaction, Town & Country quotes writer Dotson Rader, who said of the debacle: “I think he was surprised [by the reaction], but his attitude was, What did they expect? … It just astonished me; you think he’d murdered somebody.” Capote’s biographer and friend, Gerald Clarke, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://archive.vanityfair.com/article/2012/12/capotes-swan-dive data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="told Vanity Fair" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">told Vanity Fair</a> he expressed concerns to the author that the socialites would recognize themselves in “La Côte Basque 1965.” “He said, ‘Nah, they’re too dumb. They won’t know who they are,’” Clarke said. “He could not have been more wrong.”</p><img alt="a person sitting in a chair" title="tom hollander as truman capote in feud capote vs the swans" width=1600 height=1067 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gallery-tom-hollander-truman-capote-0113-v3-6535953a0617c.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">PARI DUKOVIC PHOTOGRAPHY</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Capote was instantly cut off by most of the Swans after Esquire published the story. “Everyone turned on him, he was a persona non grata,” writer Kelleigh Greenberg-Jephcott, whose novel Swan Song is based on the socialites’ story, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.penguin.co.uk/articles/2021/01/answered-prayers-the-mystery-manuscript-that-devastated-truman data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="told Penguin" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">told Penguin</a>. The Swan who was Capote’s closest friend, Babe Paley, apparently didn’t speak to him ever again, and he was not invited to her funeral when she died in 1978. According to Biography, Slim Keith considered suing the author for libel, while Ann Woodward died of a suspected suicide prior to the story’s publication, the presumption being that she had read an advance copy.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Capote’s life became consumed by drugs and alcohol</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Capote released two more chapters from the Answered Prayers manuscript, “Unspoiled Monsters” and “Kate McCloud,” but the complete book never materialized. After being ostracized by his closest friends, the author turned to drink and drugs to occupy his time, Penguin says. He spent much of his time at nightclub Studio 54, and despite an intervention by his friend C.Z. Guest, his attempts at rehab were unsuccessful.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">His substance abuse had a devastating effect on Capote’s health, and the writer experienced collapses and seizures, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/truman-capotes-unhappy-ending data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=PBS class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">PBS</a> says.

The cause of death was listed as “liver disease complicated by phlebitis and multiple drug intoxication,” PBS says; Entertainment Weekly reports that Capote died of an overdose caused by Valium, codeine, and barbiturates.</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">The Swans were the “original Real Housewives”</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Speaking to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/arts-and-culture/a45050439/feud-capote-swans-demi-moore-chloe-sevigny-diane-lane/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Town & Country" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Town & Country</a>, Feud co-creator Ryan Murphy described the Swans: “They were like the original Real Housewives … That’s something now that people are obsessed with.” Gossip columnist and publicist R. Couri Hay, who worked for Andy Warhol, told the publication that the way Capote exploited his friends had a lot in common with the reality-TV mega-franchise. “Truman’s story showed you the innermost secrets of a group of people who were idolized,” Hay said. “It wasn’t reality TV, it was reality.”</p><img alt='fx’s feud capote vs the swans "pilot" premieres wednesday, january 31 at 10 pm etpt pictured center tom hollander as truman capote cr fx' title='fx’s feud capote vs the swans "pilot" premieres wednesday, january 31 at 10 pm etpt pictured center tom hollander as truman capote cr fx' width=3000 height=1252 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/feud-301cdfb-lock-121823-new-01-sub-copy-65b9674ce0971.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of FX</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">To re-create the glamor of New York society in the 1970s, Feud: Capote vs. the Swans enlists some of Hollywood’s most iconic stars. Naomi Watts takes on the role of Babe Paley, wife of CBS founder William S. Paley (played by Treat Williams) and an extremely close friend of Capote’s. Chloë Sevigny stars as Warhol muse C.Z.

Molly Ringwald plays Joanne Carson (late-night TV legend Johnny Carson’s second wife), and Demi Moore portrays Ann Woodward, famously known as the widow of banking heir Billy Woodward. Diane Lane completes the cast as Slim Keith, who discovered Lauren Bacall, bringing the future star to the attention of her director husband, Howard Hawks.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s unsurprising that Capote’s dramatic falling-out with a group of high society’s most respected women forms the basis of Feud’s second season. As Murphy noted in his interview with Town & Country: “A feud is never about hatred; a feud is about pain, always. For the show to work, there had to be a great split that was about heartache as opposed to hatred.”</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/32a17ebf-adab-48ef-a723-758c53a8bea8_1524066273.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Amy Mackelden" title="Headshot of Amy Mackelden" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Amy Mackelden is a freelance writer, editor, and disability activist.
