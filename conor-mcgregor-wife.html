He says that being able to “give her everything she’s ever wanted” has been one of his biggest joys and “fills him with pride”.</p><p>Devlin has spoken about how she always knew he was going to be a star and never doubted him for a second. “It’s weird for me to say but we just always knew he was going to get to this level and every few months it just keeps going and going and going and the sky’s the limit.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=8.447662601626><h2><strong>Who Are Conor McGregor and Dee Devlin's Children?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/4.png><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>After 12 years together, Conor McGregor and Dee Devlin got engaged in 2020 and are currently still planning their big wedding.
