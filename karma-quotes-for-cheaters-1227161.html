It undermines trust, breaks hearts, and leaves a trail of broken promises, a prevalent problem in relationships that reverberates through the lives of those involved. In this exploration of poetic justice, we delve into the captivating world of karma quotes for cheaters, where the repercussions of infidelity unfold. The ultimate fate of those who betray loyalty, trust, and love is painfully expressed in retribution quotes for liars.&nbsp;</p><p>Our contributor Bayu Prihandito,certified psychology expert & life coach, believes that karma quotes can serve as reminders to avoid cheating in the first place. They give us a sense of ethics and morale. He adds, “For example, the quote "What goes around, comes around" can be a strong reminder that all our actions inevitably have consequences. It's like a mirror reflecting back on your actions, making you think twice before making a wrong move.”</p><p>They serve as mirrors, reflecting the consequences that cheaters face but also offering hope and redemption. They inspire transformation and growth, reminding cheaters that no action goes unpunished or unrewarded. Through the emotional pain, there is the potential for self-reflection, growth, and rebuilding shattered trust.

And that can become a vicious, downward cycle.

MacDonald</p><p>19.“If he knew one thing about life, it was this: look out for yourself. No one else would do it for you. If you were cheated or tricked, it was your own fault, and a lesson best learned before the world devoured you.” — Kelley Armstrong</p><p>As per our contributor Bayu Prihandito, karma quotes can encourage forgiveness and second chances. He adds, “Karma quotes often promote forgiveness and second chances. One of my favorites is "Holding onto anger is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die" from Malachy McCourt. This quote often helps people realize that forgiveness is more for their own peace of mind than for the other person.

Other people see love as a game, where the goal is to manipulate another individual and gain emotional power over a partner.
