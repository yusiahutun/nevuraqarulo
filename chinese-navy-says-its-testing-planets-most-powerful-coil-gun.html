It can be fired repeatedly and rapidly without causing wear on components.</p>Coil guns could revolutionise the way that wars are fought, allowing for faster, more accurate and devastating attacks on enemy targets. They could also launch missiles or send <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">satellites</span></a> into space.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The technology has been around for decades, but challenges in materials science and electronics have made it difficult to build large and powerful models.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One of the closest competitors to the Chinese coil gun, a 120mm-calibre electromagnetic coil mortar test device at the Sandia National Laboratories in the United States, can fire a projectile weighing 18kg. It is among the largest of these devices ever built.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Other systems around the world typically can fire projectiles weighing only a few grams and with a diameter of a few millimetres, according to a study published by Israeli scientists in the journal Scientific Reports in January.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The larger a coil gun, the better its ability to fire projectiles similar to those fired by traditional artillery. A standard 155mm artillery shell used by the US military weighs around 43kg, while Italy’s Indigo anti-aircraft defence missile weighs 120kg.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The coil gun has a number of advantages over traditional artillery, including higher launch speeds, lower launch costs and shorter preparation time, according to the Chinese team led by professor Guan Xiaocun with the Naval University of Engineering.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It has the potential for revolutionary breakthroughs in terms of speed, range, power, accuracy, safety, flexibility and reliability,” Guan and his colleagues wrote in a paper published in the peer-reviewed journal Transactions of China Electrotechnical Society this month.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It is widely applicable in areas such as weapon systems, near-Earth satellites and high-speed missile launches.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Their 30-stage coil gun is still in the testing phase, and it is unclear when or if it will be deployed in the field. However, the Chinese military has been investing heavily in the technology in recent years.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The Naval University of Engineering has overcome a series of difficulties” in building a large coil gun, said Ma Weiming, lead scientist of the Chinese military’s electromagnetic launch programme in a paper published in June.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ma said the challenges included the design and manufacturing of large-calibre high-magnetic-density coils and compact pulsed power technology.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He added that China was developing an even more powerful coil gun capable of launching a projectile at a speed of 3,600km/h, which could push the weapon’s kill range to over 100km.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Chinese researchers turn to AI to build futuristic weapons</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The rapid development of coil guns in China was in part due to a breakthrough in sensor technology, according to Guan’s team.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Coil guns generate a strong magnetic field when fired, which can interfere with electronic devices and sensors, so research on electromagnetic launchers typically requires measuring the projectile’s flight behaviour through external means.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, Guan’s team came up with a new smart projectile equipped with sensors that are shielded from electromagnetic interference thanks to special materials, allowing them to collect high-quality data about projectile flight behaviour. This precise data from internal sensors can help scientists improve the efficiency and stability of coil guns.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Maintaining a projectile’s suspension in the centre of the coil during launch can be a challenge, as any deviation from the centre can cause the projectile to touch the wall of the barrel and affect its trajectory.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The onboard sensors helped the Chinese scientists detect issues that were missed by computer modelling.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to the team, at the start of the launch, the test projectile was at the bottom of the drive coil because of gravity. When the pulsed current was turned on, the test projectile was pushed upwards by the electromagnetic force.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Because the electromagnetic force was stronger at the tail of the projectile, it caused the projectile to tilt and collide with the inner wall of the drive coil, which made the acceleration data fluctuate, they said. When the test projectile passed through the later stages, it started to wobble because the pulse current was triggered at the wrong time.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Discoveries like this can help scientists improve the performance of coil guns. For instance, the wobbling can be reduced by adjusting the trigger time for the pulse current that passes through the coils.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miaoaGelny0r8iepZydX5a%2FtbXCpZxoa2Jof3OBl2iaoaGemsCmec2arbJlo5bGtHnIrapmrJWowaq6xmanpZmemsG0ecyoqq1loKTEpr7FrqNmm5%2BeuW6z1Kc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./hard-rock-cafe-to-open-in-destin-florida.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Hard Rock Cafe To Open In Destin, Florida</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./wuppertaler-sv-21-football-club-facts.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Wuppertaler SV: 21 Football Club Facts</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./french-montanas-solid-wallet-explains-why-he-aint-worried-bout-nothin.html>French Montanas solid wallet explains why he Aint Worried Bout Nothin Tue 5 July 2022</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-jackson-new-album-songs-for-mother-daughters.html>Alan Jackson's New Album Features Songs for His Late Mother, More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-f1cf0f18-55b5-552e-a3b7-517c726ba35c-html.html>Eagles C Jason Kelce retires after 13 seasons | National</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65b82c73268e3ecb698b458b-html.html>Resultados Progol 2213: premios y quiniela ganadora del fin de semana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-cbd-products.html>What Is It, Is It Legal, And Will It Get You High?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib.
