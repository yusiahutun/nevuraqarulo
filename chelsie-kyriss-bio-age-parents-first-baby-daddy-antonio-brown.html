Here, you’ll learn about her age, her parents, her first baby daddy, and her job.</p><p>Scroll down as this Chelsie Kyriss Bio unfolds further details about Antonio Brown Baby Mama.</p><h3><strong>Meet Chelsie Kyriss, Antonio Brown’s Baby Mama</strong></h3><p>Chelsie Kyriss is best known as the baby mother of Antonio Brown. Two of them are parents to four children and maintain on-and-off relationships frequently. There have been several issues between the two over the years. Like in December 2019, Antonio tried to evict Chelsie from his home in Florida.</p><p>Antonio reportedly asked her to leave and handed her legal paperwork which she refused to do. According to the document obtained by The Blast, the NFL player requested “default judgment” on the case. In a separate incident, The Sporting News reported that Antonio called the police on Chelsie and accused her of stealing a car from his house.</p><p>Furthermore, CheatSheet reported that she also filed her lawsuit, seeking primary custody of their three boys, as well as child support.</p><p>However, they got back together after reconciling their differences in April 2020 and were together over the summer. HotNewHipHop reported that Antonio spoke to SupaCiny and DJ Entice in a radio program and opened up about how important family was for him and what he had put Chelsie through and how much she supported him in the middle of it.</p><p>But, the change of heart occurred after his arrest in January 2020 on three separate counts; burglary with assault or battery, burglary of an unoccupied conveyance, and criminal mischief. Not long after, he released a statement that included an apology to his baby mother on his Instagram.</p><p>In March 2020, he announced that Chelsie Kyriss and Antonio Brown were engaged on his Instagram. And, a few days later, he also revealed that his baby mama was pregnant with his fourth child. Their latest child named A.K.B. wasn’t made public. But, later it was revealed two of them welcomed a daughter named Allure.</p><p>As for Chelsie, she released a statement on her Instagram in January 2021, asking Antonio to seek help. She shared that she “watched the rise and fall of an incredible man and athlete.” This is why she and her kids distanced themselves from him. She hoped that he “will get help and seek the mental health treatment that he so desperately needs.”</p><p>Moreover, the statement came out after Antonio threw a bag of gummy penises at officers and his ex while taunting “bag of d***s for the d***s” after calling them on her for attempting to “steal his car”. Chelsie mentioned that it was a sign of a “desperate” need for “mental health treatment”.</p><p>Back to their relationship, the two began dating one another in 2012 but split several times over the years. They welcomed their first child Autonomy Brown in April 2014. Their second one Ali Brown was born in March 2015, followed by their third Apollo Brown in August 2017.</p><p>But the question remains, are Chelsie and Antonio still together?</p><p>Back in July 2021, reports appeared online that Antonio was spotted vacationing with Cyndey Moreau, an Instagram model. The Tampa Bay Times reported on Nov. 18, 2021, that Cyndey approached her beau’s former chef Steven Ruiz to obtain counterfeit COVID-19 immunization cards, telling him that Brown would pay $500 for a Johnson & Johnson vaccination card.</p><p>The chef went public with the exchange after not being able to collect the $10,000 he claims Antonio owed him.</p><p>So, it appears Chelsie is not dating her baby father. They appeared together on the NFL player’s post in April 2021. Although @Operation5am posted a picture of them together in June 2021, the time the picture was taken remains unknown.</p><p>Plus, that Antonio might be dating Cydney, has confirmed that they are not together anymore.</p><h3><strong>Does Chelsie Kyriss Have A Daughter?</strong></h3><p>Chelsie Kyriss has two daughters Brooklyn Green and Allure Brown.
