If your children are sick with diarrhoea, don't let them swim in pools.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Above all keep your head above the water and don't inadvertently swallow it.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Breaststroke is preferable to crawl, or backstroke, as you will swallow less.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Take your children to the bathroom regularly and change babies' nappies away from the swimming pool to avoid spreading bugs. If you, or your children have had norovirus or diarrhoea, wait for at least two weeks until you go swimming.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>People over 50, especially those with chronic lung disease, or current or former smokers, should see a doctor immediately if they develop pneumonia symptoms after swimming in a pool, or soaking in a hot tub and mention any possible exposure to Legionella and Pseudomonas, such as swimming in the pool of a hotel, or cruise ship.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKCVlrm1tI6aqa2hk6GyboKPbG9ybWVkpKmt02abnpmUocZursCcq56qmZZ6rbXErGSsr5miuqq6xmanqKecYpmms8iopaeZmaeytHnDoqqemaOaeqm702arrppdp660tI2hq6ak</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./adam-craig-just-a-phase.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Adam Craig, 'Just a Phase' [Listen]</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./397039-top-15-black-female-gospel-singers-time-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Top 15 black female gospel singers of all time</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./french-montanas-solid-wallet-explains-why-he-aint-worried-bout-nothin.html>French Montanas solid wallet explains why he Aint Worried Bout Nothin Tue 5 July 2022</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-jackson-new-album-songs-for-mother-daughters.html>Alan Jackson's New Album Features Songs for His Late Mother, More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-f1cf0f18-55b5-552e-a3b7-517c726ba35c-html.html>Eagles C Jason Kelce retires after 13 seasons | National</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65b82c73268e3ecb698b458b-html.html>Resultados Progol 2213: premios y quiniela ganadora del fin de semana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-cbd-products.html>What Is It, Is It Legal, And Will It Get You High?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib.
