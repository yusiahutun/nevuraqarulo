Through this, Eldoret will be self-sufficient in its water supply for the next century. That is why this is a very important investment," Biwott added.<h2>What the whole project will entail</h2><p class=align-left>The rehabilitation will involve the upgrade and reconstruction of an existing dam located on the Kipsinende River on the outskirts of Eldoret Town.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/fdc7fdd8370c21c0.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kenyan Newspapers Review: Former Barmaid Beats Odds to Score B+ in 2023 KCSE</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The main project components include the construction of a 16.95 Mm3 water storage dam and a 74.167 m3/day water treatment plant (WTP).</p><p class=align-left>Additionally, the project will lay a clear water pipeline from the new WTP to the Sosiani WTP, a distribution pipeline, and establish 31,600 m3 of flow-balancing reservoirs.</p><p class=align-left><strong>TUKO.co.ke </strong>understands that Eldoret currently has 500,000 inhabitants, and the water demand is increasing.</p><p class=align-left>But upon completion, the Two Rivers Dam project will further provide annually up to 1,000 individually metered connections to the unserved or new population in Eldoret town and its peri-urban areas, and management services to reduce non-revenue water to below 25% by 2025.</p><h2>Why there is a demand for more water supply in Eldoret</h2><p class=align-left>According to statistics, the demand for water in Eldoret is much faster increasing with the population than the increase in connection to consumers.</p>"In Eldoret, we have about 80% connectivity in terms of water connectivity and about 30% in terms of sewage connectivity. But still, even with the number of connections, we lack 20 million litres of water per day," Biwott explained.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b0fea6ceda9241e4.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>William Ruto's Govt to Tax Farmers 5% for Every KSh 100 Made from Sale of Their Farm Produce</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Biwott further said that currently, ELDOWAS supplies about 42.5 million litres per day, but the demand for Eldoret is about 65 million litres per day.</p>"So, there is a lot of strain.

Eldoret-Iten Water Fund is one of the water funds that we are implementing," he said.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/3910813be8da541b.png><p class=align-left>Other water funds in the country include the Upper Tana <a href=# rel=noopener>Nairobi</a> Water Fund, the Jumuia Water Fund, and the River Yala Water Fund, which is the only women-led water fund in the world.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/3968f8a0a4a134e2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kenya Newspapers Review: Uhuru Kenyatta's Rise in Mt Kenya Threatens Rigathi Gachagua's Gains</span></p></a>"At TNC, we understand that towns are growing. For instance, Eldoret Town is gearing up for its city status, and there is also the creation of economic zones, all of which require water supply failure, to which we may lose potential investors," Kibet explained.<h2>Why Eldoret is a significant town in Kenya</h2><p class=align-left>Meanwhile, Biwott, who doubles as the vice chairperson of the Eldoret water and sanitation service providers, focusing on advocacy, disclosed that he has been pushing for a climate-smart tariff.</p>"In the initial agreement with TNC for the development of the Eldoret-Iten Water Fund, I signed a commitment that we were going to contribute to the sustainability of the fund through our tariff. 3% of our earnings as ELDOWAS will now go towards climate action. It was 1%, but we have now increased it to 3%," he explained.<p class=align-left><strong>TUKO.co.ke</strong> previously reported that Eldoret,<a href=#> being the headquarters of Uasin Gishu county</a>, is the home of President William Ruto, who is the fifth president of Kenya.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/18b5b42e3b7ccf39.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kimani Ichung'wah Shares Plans to Probe Uhuru Kenyatta and His Govt Through State Capture Commission</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Besides being known for world-beating athletes, Eldoret is among the cities synonymous with food production, with maize and wheat being key crops in Uasin Gishu and neighbouring counties.</p><p class=align-left>The county also boasts Kenya's second-oldest referral hospital, <a href=#>Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital</a> (MTRH), and other high-end facilities like Eldoret Hospital, Mediheal Hospital, Reale Hospital, St Lukes Orthopaedics and Trauma Hospital, and Top Hill, among others.</p><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnC3xKewmmeTpMKvwMieqmhtY2iEeoOMoKavrF2Wua27wpqrnqtdoMCpeZFppGaqlZ2uo7XLoquarJmku26%2ByK%2Bcq6tdma6uecSlm6iqlal6tLHEpKpmm5mpxm6%2F05qrrqtf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./meaning-of-saturday-by-childish-gambino.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Meaning of Saturday by Childish Gambino</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kathleen-zellner-face-plastic-surgery-husband-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Do You Know All About Kathleen Zellner?
