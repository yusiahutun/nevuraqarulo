When the 29-year-old learned the "Big Mouth" star had been admitted, he called to make sure his friend was okay.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:91625874-1271-44d6-8f9f-26e38ecde5fd data-container-ref=toofab:article:3d74a65d-bfd7-449d-8e98-e7eb04e15deb data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/f4/5by4/2022/03/17/f4325be636b54c90acfce858aa41d8b3_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Olivia Munn Opens Up About Postpartum Journey 3 Months After Giving Birth to Son Malcolm</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>According to Mulaney, Pete frequently changes his phone number and often sends a text with a selfie as proof of identity. At one point, the comedian recalled having "nine Pete Davidsons saved" in his phone. When that became "too many Pete Davidsons," the "Saturday Night Live" alum began saving his new numbers under the names of increasingly famous actors.</p><p>At the time of John's admission, the "Bupkis" actor was saved under "Al Pacino," which led the nurse on duty to urgently wake him from his sedative induced sleep after five missed calls from the Academy Award winner.</p><p>"What the nurse sees on the phone, is that this unconscious patient is getting not one, not two, but five missed calls from Oscar winner Al Pacino," he recalled. "So, she f--king wakes me up. I don't blame her, I would have been so curious."</p><p>Mulaney also clarified to the audience that he has "never done drugs with Pete," to dispel any public speculation after the "Live From New York" comedian expressed concern that people may "blame" him for John's addiction.</p><p>"No one's going to blame you," Mulaney remembered reassuring Davidson over the phone.</p><p>"Some people suggested he and I did drugs together because he has tattoos and I am plain," the "Puss in Boots: Last Wish" actor explained. "I've never done drugs with Pete. He's always been very supportive of my sobriety."</p><p>Back in September 2021, Mulaney first revealed how <a href=#>Seth Meyers </a>and other friends had staged an intervention in 2020 during an appearance on "Late Night."</p><p>"I love you, Seth. You know, you guys saved me from drugs," he said, before referencing his relationship with actress <a href=#>Olivia Munn</a> and their baby son. "And Olivia and this baby have helped save me from myself, and this early journey out of recovery."</p><a id=gallery-link-93335c12-d4ed-4fc5-9974-0f30dc4c86bb class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:93335c12-d4ed-4fc5-9974-0f30dc4c86bb data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:3d74a65d-bfd7-449d-8e98-e7eb04e15deb data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/f3/4by3/2023/04/24/f32cf71b133d4e71bdfb2d2d80ef1d4e_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j21ma21fn7ypuoymrKWZnprGbrzErZxmnJGrtqW%2Fzqdkn6GiqMFuwM5mmpqknGK1qrmMoqVmqpWdrqN7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./plastic-surgery-addict-jenny-lee-forced-accept-looks-sudden-weight-gain-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Plastic surgery addict Jenny Lee on being forced to accept her looks after sudden weight gain</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./its-pink-pajama-party-time.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Its Pink Pajama Party time</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./french-montanas-solid-wallet-explains-why-he-aint-worried-bout-nothin.html>French Montanas solid wallet explains why he Aint Worried Bout Nothin Tue 5 July 2022</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-jackson-new-album-songs-for-mother-daughters.html>Alan Jackson's New Album Features Songs for His Late Mother, More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-f1cf0f18-55b5-552e-a3b7-517c726ba35c-html.html>Eagles C Jason Kelce retires after 13 seasons | National</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65b82c73268e3ecb698b458b-html.html>Resultados Progol 2213: premios y quiniela ganadora del fin de semana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-cbd-products.html>What Is It, Is It Legal, And Will It Get You High?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib.
