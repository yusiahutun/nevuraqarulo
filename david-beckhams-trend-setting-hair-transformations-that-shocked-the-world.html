They were constantly splashing the front pages of magazines and newspapers not only by dint of their romance and status but because they were embracing dressing as one.</p><p>David may not have been the only 90s heartthrob to rock some curtains, but his look stands out as memorable in celebrity culture. Ben Vowles, Master Barber at the celebrity-adored swanky barbers in <a href=# rel=nofollow><strong>London, Murdock</strong></a>, told HELLO!: <strong>"No one has done as much for men's hairdressing as David Beckham.</strong></p><p>"As a footballer, he set the way for men to experiment with their hair and beauty.

What had happened to Becks' beautiful blonde locks? Jaws did indeed drop but suffice to say, many men followed suit.</p><p>Ben added: "This style is bold, much like with the ponytail, you'll need strong features for this style - there's nowhere to hide.&nbsp;</p><p>"Beck's expertly paired this with some great stubble, this is something we recommend to any client getting a buzzcut."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/8d05edd89244-gettyimages-957356.jpg><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=8d05edd89244-gettyimages-957356>The moment that shocked the world</h2><p>It wasn't long before David then decided to embrace his hair growing back with his memorable mohawk.&nbsp;</p><p>Cue half the men in Britain walking around with strips of hair on their head à la Becks.<br></p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">Don't miss...</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="David Beckham pens heartfelt tribute to mum Sandra - and it's so relatable" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/aa0086c63d58-gettyimages-1780933149.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="David Beckham pens heartfelt tribute to mum Sandra - and it's so relatable" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>David Beckham pens heartfelt tribute to mum Sandra - and it's so relatable</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="David and Harper Beckham's sweetest daddy-daughter moments revealed" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/4a343f3164db-harper-beckham-david-field.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="David and Harper Beckham's sweetest daddy-daughter moments revealed" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>David and Harper Beckham's sweetest daddy-daughter moments revealed</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Romeo Beckham is his dad David's double in heartwarming photo" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/0251dba600b7-david-romeo-beckham.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Romeo Beckham is his dad David's double in heartwarming photo" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Romeo Beckham is his dad David's double in heartwarming photo</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/db79ebab56cf-david-ponytail.jpg><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=db79ebab56cf-david-ponytail>New beginnings</h2><p>A new team in a new country came knocking on the athlete's door and as fashion evolved, so did his 'do.&nbsp;</p><p>In classic David style, the then-Real Madrid star went from one extreme to the other and decided to grow out his locks and rock a longer length cut, and his ponytail became somewhat iconic.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#><strong>Victoria Beckham shares never-before-seen photo of four children as she reflects on special time in her life</strong></a></p><p>"Beckham's hair at Madrid was arguably as provocative as his form on the pitch," explained Barber Ben.
