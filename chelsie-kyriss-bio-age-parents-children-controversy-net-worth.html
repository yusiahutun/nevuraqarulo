She was formerly married and had two children named&nbsp; <strong>Kellen Green</strong> and <strong>Brooklyn Green</strong> from the relationship. However, she has not revealed any details about her previous relationship. There is also very little information regarding the whereabouts of her kids from the relationship. But it was revealed that she has not been in contact with her children, Kellen, and Brooklyn.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allstarbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Annotation-2020-01-14-143135-300x290.png><p>As Chelsie was moving on with her life after a failed marriage, she got introduced to American footballer Antonio Brown through a mutual friend. The two got along very well and soon announced their relationship in 2011.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allstarbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Annotation-2020-01-14-143410-220x300.png><p>The couple has three children together. They welcomed their firstborn, <strong><span>Antony,</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span><span>in 2014. Their second son&nbsp;</span><span><strong>Ali</strong> was born in 2015, and their third child&nbsp;</span><span><strong>Apollo</strong> was born in 2017. Antonio also shares two children from his former relationship with <strong>Shameika Ford</strong></span></p><h2>Alleged Relationship</h2><p>When Chelsie was pregnant with their third child Apollo, in 2017, Antonio Brown started a relationship with an Instagram Model<strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal> Jena Frumes</a>.</strong> Antonio’s cheating scandal led the couple to end their relationship. However, in 2018, they both reconciled after<strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal> Antonio broke up with Jena Frumes</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allstarbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Annotation-2020-01-14-143947-300x271.png><p>Unfortunately, the couple broke up again around in mid-2019. Their break-up stirred lots of controversies in the media after Antonio tweeted, “No more white woman 2020,” and later called Chelsie just his baby mama of 3. He also went on to send an evacuation notice to Chelsie, asking her to leave his place.</p><p>Moreover, On January 13, 2020, there was a police showdown after Antonio accused Chelsie of trying to steal his Bentley. He also called her nasty stuff and swore at her in from of their kids. He yelled at Chelsie, saying, “Bitch, you don’t drive Bentleys. This is not your life.”</p><p>He also swore at the police officers present at the site, asking them to do their work correctly. This scene he made outside his house might have as well ended his career. Besides, he is also labeled as a “racist” and accused of being “mentally unstable.”</p><h2>Net Worth</h2><p>Chelsie is estimated to have earned around <strong>$200,000&nbsp;</strong>from her previous works as an assistant teacher, marketing official, <span>as an associate shop supervisor and shop director. However, Chelsie stopped working after her relationship with <strong>Antonio Brown</strong>. She has no income source as of now. According to <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer external" data-wpel-link=external>Celebrity Net Worth</a>,&nbsp;</strong>Antonio is estimated to have a net worth of <strong>$25million.</strong> On January 5, 2019, Brown bought a Porsche for Chelsie.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allstarbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Annotation-2020-01-14-144308.png><p>She captioned the picture writing&nbsp; “Twin Turbos!&nbsp;#FBF”.
