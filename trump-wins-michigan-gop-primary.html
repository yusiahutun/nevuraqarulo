As of Tuesday night, he was leading Haley by under 40 points.</p><p>In remarks to the Michigan GOP after the race was called, Trump said the numbers were “far greater than we even anticipated” and pointed toward the general election in November.</p><p>“We win Michigan, we win the whole thing,” Trump said.</p><p>After her Palmetto State loss Saturday, Haley re-upped her promise to stay in the race even as she continues to trail Trump, pointing toward Super Tuesday, March 5. She didn’t heavily invest in&nbsp;Michigan’s contest, leading observers to see the state as all but sealed for Trump.</p><p>Haley’s camp framed the Michigan results as a “warning sign” for Trump the general election.</p><p>“Joe Biden is losing about 20 percent&nbsp;of the Democratic vote today, and many say it’s a sign of his weakness in November. Donald Trump is losing about 35 percent&nbsp;of the vote. That’s a flashing warning sign for Trump in November,” the campaign’s national spokesperson, Olivia Perez-Cubas said in a statement. She noted Michigan Republicans&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>lost control of</a> the state Legislature and the governor’s mansion in recent years, and that the state party has been&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>embroiled in turmoil</a>.</p><p>“Let this serve as another warning sign that what has happened in Michigan will continue to play out across the country. So long as Donald Trump is at the top of the ticket, Republicans will keep losing to the socialist left,” Perez-Cubas said.</p><p>Only some of&nbsp;Michigan’s 55 delegates will be allocated based on the night’s results, amid a new nominating setup and ongoing confusion in the state’s leadership.</p><p>A majority of the delegates are set to be allocated Saturday, when the state party holds a convention. Recent discord within the&nbsp;Michigan&nbsp;GOP,&nbsp;however, led to confusion after two figures claimed&nbsp;the top leadership role and slated two separate conventions for the weekend.&nbsp;</p><p>A faction led by former Michigan Rep.&nbsp;Pete Hoekstra,&nbsp;who’s been backed by the national party and by Trump to take the reins of the&nbsp;Michigan&nbsp;GOP, has plans to host one convention —&nbsp;while Kristina Karamo, who had insisted she was still in charge of the state party after her ouster last month, made plans to host a rival convention on the same day.</p><p>But a judge&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>ruled Tuesday that</a> Karamo&nbsp;was removed from the party chair position back in January and that any of her actions since “purporting to be taken on behalf of the Michigan Republican State Committee are void and have no effect.”</p><p>Trump affirmed Hoekstra in his post-race remarks Tuesday, saying he’ll be a “fantastic chairman, one of the best ever.”</p><p>Trump now appears set to&nbsp;head into Super Tuesday with a string of early-state wins after beating Haley in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, as well as snagging all the delegates available in Nevada.&nbsp;He also won&nbsp;the U.S. Virgin Islands’&nbsp;GOP caucus earlier this month.</p><p>Meanwhile, on the Democratic ticket in&nbsp;Michigan, President Biden is dealing with a push for a protest vote amid frustration from progressives over the administration’s actions around the war in Gaza.</p><p>Trump flipped the state out of Democrats’ hands in 2016, but Biden won in 2020 — setting the state up to be a key battleground in 2024.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfnbatuIyppqWhpJ6wtHvTq6ymqF2stq%2B%2FjKagnKCZnK6vecaop2aoop66or7YaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./passenger-killed-in-jo-daviess-county-crash.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>UPDATE: passenger identified in Jo Daviess County fatal crash</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./megan-piper-porn-star-banned-prom-mike-stone-asks-date-twitter-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Megan Piper: Porn star banned from prom after Mike Stone asks her to be his date on Twitter</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./french-montanas-solid-wallet-explains-why-he-aint-worried-bout-nothin.html>French Montanas solid wallet explains why he Aint Worried Bout Nothin Tue 5 July 2022</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-jackson-new-album-songs-for-mother-daughters.html>Alan Jackson's New Album Features Songs for His Late Mother, More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-f1cf0f18-55b5-552e-a3b7-517c726ba35c-html.html>Eagles C Jason Kelce retires after 13 seasons | National</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65b82c73268e3ecb698b458b-html.html>Resultados Progol 2213: premios y quiniela ganadora del fin de semana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-cbd-products.html>What Is It, Is It Legal, And Will It Get You High?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib.
