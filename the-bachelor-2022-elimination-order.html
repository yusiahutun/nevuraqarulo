winner?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Susie-The-Bachelor.jpg><p>Who is The Bachelor 2022 winner? Reality Steve confirmed that the winner of The Bachelor season 26 with Clayton Echard is Susie Evans, a 28-year-old wedding videographer from Virginia Beach, Virginia, however, she rejects Clayton in the end. According to Reality Steve, Susie was eliminated in third place during Fantasy Suites after Clayton told her that he was in love and had sex with his other two finalists—Rachel Recchia, a 25-year-old flight instructor from Clermont, Florida, had the first, and Gabby Windey, a 30-year-old ICU nurse from Denver, Colorado—and Susie questioned how he could be serious about their relationship when he was intimate with someone else. The fight escalates, and Clayton decides to eliminate Susie after she tells him how she doesn’t know if she can stay on the show if he’s in love with other women.</p><p>At the final three Rose Ceremony with Rachel and Gabby, Clayton tells both Rachel and Gabby that he’s in love and had sex with both of them. Both Rachel and Gabby walk away and try to leave the show, which leads Clayton to beg them to stay. Both Rachel and Gabby agree to stay and Clayton gives them both roses. The finale continues with Gabby and Rachel meeting Clayton’s parents. After Gabby and Rachel’s meeting with Clayton’s parents, Clayton realizes that he still has feelings for Susie and decides to talk to her. Host Jesse Palmer knocks on Susie’s door and tells her that Clayton wants to talk to her. Susie agrees and she and Clayton reunite. Susie then also meets Clayton’s parents, after which he decides he wants to choose her at the Final Rose Ceremony and eliminate Rachel and Gabby. Clayton tells Rachel and Gabby about his decision separately in their hotel rooms. Rachel was more sad, while Gabby was more angry at Clayton. At the Final Rose Ceremony, Clayton arrives with an engagement ring and a plan to propose to Susie, but before he can do so, Susie tells Clayton that she’s not in love with him and walks away, which forces Clayton to leave The Bachelor single.</p><p>Reality Steve also reported that Clayton’s relationships with Rachel and Gabby ended once he eliminated with them, and there’s no hope for them to get back together after he was rejected by Susie. “There is zero chance he is rekindling anything with Gabby or Rachel. They have nothing to do with anything since they left Iceland,” Reality Steve wrote.&nbsp;<span>“I don’t think anyone expected it to end the way that it did, including myself, nor did I want it to be that way. There was a lot of things that I just never would’ve thought would’ve happened the way they did. So everyone will be kind of surprised. I wish it could have went any other direction, but it went the direction that it did. Ultimately, I had to react accordingly,” Clayton said of how his </span>Bachelor<span> season ended on the Women Tell All.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Though Reality Steve couldn’t confirm Clayton and Susie’s relationship, he reported that it’s unlikely they’re back together.&nbsp;Reality Steve also reported that both Susie and Gabby are frontrunner to be the season 19 Bachelorette, which starts filming in late-March. Of the two, Reality Steve believes that Gabby is the more likely choice.</p><p>Reality Steve’s spoilers come after a Reddit post by <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">@workingbach13</a> in December 2021 theorized that the final two were Susie or Rachel. The post suspected this because Susie and Rachel both followed Cary Fetman on Instagram. Cary is the Bachelor franchise’s stylist and costume designer who often styles the lead and the last two contestants for the Final Rose Ceremony.</p><p>The post speculated that Susie could’ve won Clayton’s Bachelor season because she was the first of the final three Bachelor contestants to return to social media, which has been consistent with past Bachelor and Bachelorette winners. Susie’s family and friends also follow Clayton on Instagram. A fan account has also posted an alleged screenshot of Susie commenting heart eye emojis on one of Clayton’s recent Instagram photos, which he liked. Susie also received the Pretty Woman date—a.k.a. a date where the lead and the contestant go on a shopping spree—in Vienna, Austria, in week seven, which has been indicative of other Bachelor and Bachelorette winners who have had similar dates, such as Rachel Kirkconnell from The Bachelor season 25 with Matt James; Hannah Ann Sluss from The Bachelor season 24 with Peter Weber; Becca Kufrin from The Bachelor season 22 with Arie Luyendyk Jr.; and Bryan Abasolo from The Bachelorette season 13 with Rachel Lindsay. <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Reality Steve</a> also hinted in a tweet in November 2021 that there’s evidence that Susie won Clayton’s Bachelor season. “Do I post pics of Susie from Clayton’s season out last night so the subsequent dissection of the pics, freak out, and speculation from the fans can commence?” he tweeted.</p><p class=p3>The post, however, also speculated that Rachel could’ve won Clayton’s Bachelor season because she returned to social media at the exact time Clayton did. Rachel’s mom also followed Clayton on Instagram but unfollowed him when filming ended. Rachel Clayton also both liked the same Instagram photo of The Bachelor host Jesse Palmer 20 minutes after it was posted, even though Rachel doesn’t follow Jesse on Instagram. Rachel was also the only contestant from Clayton’s final three that liked season 18 Bachelorette Michelle Young’s first photo with her winner, Nayte Olukoya, which Clayton also liked.</p><p>Reality Steve confirmed in February 2022 that Clayton does not have a traditional ending, there was no finality to his Bachelor season. Reality Steve also reported that Clayton didn’t have a traditional “Final Rose Ceremony” with two women, where he picks out a ring, one woman arrives and is eliminated and the other woman arrives and he proposes to them. Reality Steve also reported that he didn’t have any “Happy Couple” visits (a.k.a. when the Bachelor and their winner have a secret weekend together) the whole season.</p><p>For Clayton’s proposal to Susie, it’s almost certain that the ring was designed by Neil Lane, a celebrity jeweler, who has created engagement rings for The Bachelor, The Bachelorette and Bachelor in Paradise since 2008. In a 2016 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Entertainment Weekly</a>, former host Chris Harrison revealed that Bachelor Nation couples have to stay together for a certain amount of time, otherwise they have to return the free engagement ring to Neil Lane. “There’s some rule, after a certain number of years, you get to keep it anyway,” he said. “But after months… it goes back.”</p><p>Lane told <a href=# rel=noopener>StyleCaster</a> in 2016 that he doesn’t know where the rings go, but that he designs them with the hope that the couple to stays together. “I make rings hoping that people stay together forever, but after they get the ring, I don’t have a say in it, and what happens after that, I don’t know,” he said. “Where the ring goes, I have to say, I don’t really know. I just say it goes to ring heaven.”</p><h2>Who is The Bachelorette 2022?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Gabby-The-Bachelor.jpg><p>Who is the next Bachelorette in 2022? Reality Steve confirmed in March 2022 that both Susie Evans and Gabby Windey, two contestants from&nbsp;The Bachelor season 26 with Clayton Echard, are frontrunners to be the next Bachelorette in 2022. A source also told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">E! News</a> that Susie, a 28-year-old wedding videographer from Virginia Beach, Virginia, is a contender to be the next Bachelorette but producers are also “being very careful and want to see how the audience reacts to certain contestants in the final weeks of Clayton’s season.” <strong>WARNING: SPOILERS. </strong>Susie was the winner of Clayton’s Bachelor season after Clayton chose her at the Final Rose Ceremony and sent home his runner-ups: Rachel Recchia, a 25-year-old flight instructor from Clermont, Florida, and Gabby Windey, a 30-year-old ICU nurse from Denver, Colorado. Before the Final Rose Ceremony, however, Clayton and Susie have a fight during their Fantasy Suite Date after he tells her that he had sex and is in love with both Rachel and Gabby, and she questions how he could be serious about their relationship when he was intimate with someone else. The argument escalates, and Clayton decides to eliminate Susie after she expresses how she doesn’t know if she can stay on the show if he’s in love with other women. According to Reality Steve, Clayton and the producers convince Susie to return to Clayton’s Bachelor season. At the Final Rose Ceremony, Clayton—who eliminated Rachel and Gabby before the finale—told Susie he loved her, but she told him that she didn’t love him back and left. <span>“I don’t think anyone expected it to end the way that it did, including myself, nor did I want it to be that way. There was a lot of things that I just never would’ve thought would’ve happened the way they did. So everyone will be kind of surprised. I wish it could have went any other direction, but it went the direction that it did. Ultimately, I had to react accordingly,” Clayton said of how his </span>Bachelor<span> season ended on the Women Tell All.&nbsp;</span></p><p>According to Reality Steve, Clayton’s relationships with Rachel and Gabby ended once he eliminated them. Reality Steve also reported that Clayton and Susie are not back together and it’s unlikely they’ll reunite as Susie is the frontrunner to be the lead of The Bachelorette season 19, which starts filming in late March 2022. In an interview on “The Almost Famous” podcast in March 2022, Clayton revealed that he suspected Susie was trying to become the next Bachelorette after their fight during their Fantasy Suite Date.&nbsp;“I thought, ‘Why does it seem like she’s not fighting for this? Why does she seem like she can’t even give me a chance?’” he said. “I started having these really dangerous thoughts of being like, ‘What if Susie right now is just trying to get out of this? What if she’s just saying whatever she needs to say to leave me so that she can be the next Bachelorette?’” He continued, “I don’t believe that now. I didn’t believe it the next day, but I believed it in that moment and because of that I allowed my emotions to take over.”</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Us Weekly</a>, Sarah Hamrick, a 23-year-old wealth management advisor from New York City, New York, and another contestant from Clayton’s Bachelor season, revealed that Susie was her favorite to be the next Bachelorette.&nbsp; “I could see Susie doing it,” she said. “I think that she’s deserving of it. I think she would handle it very well. She’s always been very genuine to me and has good intentions, so yeah, I wouldn’t hate to see Susie.” Serene Russell, a 26-year-old elementary school teacher from Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and another contestant from Clayton’s season, also campaigned for Susie to be the next Bachelorette. “Susie is really funny too,” she said. Susie was my roommate, like, the entire time. And we would just stay up all night giggling, cracking up laughing, getting delirious.”</p><p>Reality Steve also confirmed that Gabbey Windey, a 30-year-old ICU nurse from Denver, Colorado, and a contestant from The Bachelor season 26 with Clayton Echard, is another fan favorite to be the next Bachelorette in 2022 and is more likely than Susie. A source also confirmed to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">E! News</a> in March 2022 that producers are considering Gabby to the next Bachelorette due to the positive fan response to her on social media. <span>According to Reality Steve, Gabby was eliminated in the final three on Clayton’s Bachelor season after he chose Susie Evans, a 28-year-old wedding videographer from Virginia Beach, Virginia, over Gabby and his other runner-up, Rachel Recchia, a 25-year-old flight instructor from Clermont, Florida.&nbsp; </span><span>In an interview with Us Weekly, Genevieve Parisi, a 26-year-old bartender from Los Angeles, California, revealed that Gabby was her choice for the next Bachelorette because of her sense of humor. “I would say Susie or Gabby,” she said. “Rachel is amazing too, but honestly, I think Gabby would just bring such a different element to it. She’s so funny. And as you see, as this season goes on, she really has a great heart and she’s an emotional person. And it’s hard to see that because she just jokes all the time. She’s always laughing and just joking with people, but she has a very big heart and I think she deserves love so much and she just would be so entertaining to watch.” Serene Russell, a 26-year-old elementary school teacher from Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and another contestant from Clayton’s season, also noted Gabby as strong choice for the next Bachelorette.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class=p1><span class=s1><b>Who is The Bachelor 2022, Clayton Echard?&nbsp;</b></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Clayton-Echard-The-Bachelor-2.jpg><p class=p3>In case you didn’t know: Clayton Echard is The Bachelor 2022.
