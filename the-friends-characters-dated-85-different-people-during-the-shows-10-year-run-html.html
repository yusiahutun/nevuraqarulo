By the time the show ended, five of the six main characters had found themselves in&nbsp;serious relationships. To get to those relationships, they had to date a fair number of people. Did you know that during the show’s 10-season run, the&nbsp;Friends&nbsp;gang dated 85 different people?</p><h2 id=h-friends-fans-won-t-be-surprised-to-learn-that-joey-tribbiani-had-the-most-sexual-partners>‘Friends’ fans won’t be surprised to learn that Joey Tribbiani had the most sexual partners</h2><p id=par-2_52>Of the 85 different partners featured on&nbsp;Friends, Joey dated most of them. According to a data analysis by&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vulture</a>, the womanizing actor bedded 17 different women in 10 seasons. It should come as no surprise that Joey had the most sexual partners. He was the friend who was in the fewest serious relationships.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Ross-and-Rachel-balcony.jpg><p id=par-3_101>Even though he was mostly single, Joey did have a few steady girlfriends. He was head over heels into Kate, who he met while working on a play. Kate left New York to pursue an acting job in California before their relationship could really get off the ground. He also seriously dated Kathy, who broke up with him to date Chandler Bing. Later, he dated his roommate Janine and then Charlie. Joey called it quits with Janine because she hated&nbsp;<a href=#>Chandler and Monica</a>. Charlie left him to date Ross Geller before ultimately going back to her ex. When&nbsp;Friends&nbsp;ended, Joey was still single.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-chandler-bing-dated-the-fewest-people-during-friends-10-season-run>Chandler Bing dated the fewest people during ‘Friends’ 10-season run</h2><p id=par-4_42>Joey’s longtime roommate, Chandler, wasn’t nearly as lucky in the dating department as Joey. Despite his fear of commitment, Chandler regularly committed. He either was in a relationship or a dry spell. During the show’s run, he only dated nine different women.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-5_71>To be fair, Monica and Chandler got together in season 4 of the series and later married. The length of their relationship during the show’s initial run probably explains why he had so few partners. Before he and Monica drunkenly hooked up in London, he dated Janice repeatedly. He also dated Kathy before she cheated on him, and he had&nbsp;<a href=#>an almost romance with Ginger</a>, an amputee that Joey had previously dated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-rachel-green-had-the-most-serious-relationships>Rachel Green had the most serious relationships</h2><p id=par-6_55>Ross and&nbsp;<a href=#>Phoebe Buffay</a>&nbsp;both had 16 different partners, and Monica had 13. Still, none of the three had the most serious relationships. That distinction goes to Rachel Green, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Hollywood Reporter</a>. Rachel was, by all accounts, a monogamist through and through. When the series opened, she had just left her fiancée, Barry, at the altar.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p id=par-7_67>She seriously dated Paolo in season 1 of Friends. Then she briefly dated Russ before finally settling into a long relationship with Ross. After Ross, she dated Joshua Burgin, Danny, Paul Stevens, and Tag Jones before settling down with Ross again. She even considered starting something with Joey. By the time the series wrapped, Rachel had 14 different partners, and 10 of those partners became longer-term boyfriends.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBqbGMn6minZ6ZwG6vx5qpmpukmr%2B0ecOaq56cXW2CbrDIn52eqpWjwW68xKinpZ1dmcKztc2gZK2glWLAqbvWrGRqaF2usqK%2BjKusp2aYqbqtew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jamal-anderson.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Jamal Anderson dating?
