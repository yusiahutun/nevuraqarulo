I love art, and think the relationship between fashion and art cannot be overstated. I opted for this Sleeper dress and paired it with a white bag by Aspinal of London, Kloto earrings and Rupert Sanderson block heels.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/ae997b007421-img20231031121859693.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/321cca03fea3-3534572402249336170168055116713545845151091nwebp.jpg><h2><strong>Day Two</strong></h2><p id=eeB_GfPtJzqq></p><p id=eCtYPY-aII6H>I was in Morocco on a brand trip, so chose this Jakke co-ord because it was lightweight and airy, as well as being very cute. The scarf is from a Liberty London and Gant collaboration (I have a matching shirt, too), the bag is Radley, and both the earrings and necklace are by one of my favourite jewellery brands - Alighieri. The shoes are by Each x Every.</p><h2><strong>Day Three</strong></h2><p id=e-mV0dnLXZAQ></p><p id=emn_XJHyl65B>When I got the invite to the Vanity Fair x Prada party at the Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc in Cannes, I knew I had to make a statement with whatever I wore. So I went with this vampy De La Vali dress and these beautiful earrings by Completedworks- another great jewellery brand. I also brought my favourite Prada bag as when at a Prada party...what else!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/fccb5f2d0c70-snapinstaapp3476244667787331869662735336105456539764877n1080.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/daae66013c6a-johanneswarnkexselfridges-069.jpg><h2>Day Four</h2><p id=eri9T3L-sKZr></p><p id=ej2E4tvfSQOi>For this brand dinner, I kept things quite simple as I was running around most of the day. I wore a Damson Madder dress (I love Damson Madder, it kind of has Ganni vibes which I also love) with Penelope Chivers boots and my Mulberry Bag. I also went with silver jewellery - which is actually quite rare for me, but I'm embracing these days - by a brand called Namaste.</p><h2>Day Five</h2><p id=eUzuKYbTuMVA></p><p id=eQFNZFDoVfTw>Despite the majority of my outfit choices being quite monotone, I'm a big fan of colour. This was the red carpet for the unveiling of the 2024 Pirelli calendar and I chose this yellow Roksanda dress because I loved the interesting silhouette. Roksanda very kindly dressed me for the occasion and sent me these very fun boots too! I brought along my white Aspinal of London bag which matched my pearl earrings from Toolally, and a bangle which was from a Jigsaw x Collagerie collaboration to finish off the look.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/a658c15667ab-img20231204123900907.jpg><h2>The Fashion Insider Low-Down:</h2><p id=e2w2CORzPj data-wc=10><strong>Can you describe your personal style in a few words?&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eVI4e7j6cQ8 data-wc=62>How does it reflect your role in the fashion industry? I would say my personal style is definitely eclectic and changeable, depending on what mood I'm in. &nbsp;I take a fun-first approach to clothes and heavily identify with the concept of 'man-repeller dressing', defined as 'outfitting oneself in a sartorially offensive way that will result in repelling members of the opposite sex.'</p><p id=ey88N0o8w1 data-wc=13><strong>What's your go-to outfit for a busy day of fashion events and meetings?</strong></p><p id=eko4D-TSfss data-wc=88>How do you balance comfort and style? If it's a busy day, then comfort outranks style for me. The only time I live by the adage 'pain equals beauty' is on the red carpet. Usually, I'll go for something oversized but chic, with a comfortable shoe (long live the kitten heel - I live for a low shoe). This is where accessories come into play because I'll then wear an amazing bag or some fabulous jewellery to dress it up in a way that doesn't impact my comfort.&nbsp;</p><p id=e3yTxHf8PAm data-wc=5><strong>What are your go-to brands?</strong></p><p id=eEdMINcS4i8 data-wc=72>I could wax lyrical about my favourite brands all day, but some go-to's are Eudon Choi, Damson Madder, Aeron, Baum und Pferdgarten for everyday outfits. When it comes to more statement dressing, I am often in David Koma, Vivienne Westwood, Roksanda, Chopova Lowena, Louboutin, Staud, Christian Esber and Ahluwalia. I am partial to a Gucci bag and am obsessed with NEOUS shoes, which are super comfortable but also gorgeous to look at.&nbsp;</p><p id=ejpyUHqSl82 data-wc=18><strong>Do you have any fashion icons or inspirations that influence your style choices? How do they inspire you?</strong></p><p id=e9Zb_8Sp8ku data-wc=80>I'm someone who most likes to show out on the red carpet and my biggest inspirations right now are Golda Rosheuvel, Anne Hathaway, Taylor Russell, Celine Dion, Zendaya and Hunter Schafer - they never miss. I've always been a fan of Solange's clothes more generally and like everyone else, Chloe Sevigny - they are both effortlessly chic and timeless. But I'd say my number one inspiration is Tracee Ellis Ross. When it comes to fashion, she can do no wrong!</p><p id=e7Q0kbyFfLF data-wc=19><strong>Weekdays can be hectic. What's your weekday workwear wardrobe like, and how does it differ from your weekend attire?</strong></p><p id=eT2BW2T5eDr data-wc=57>My weekday workwear wardrobe changes every day because every day is so different. What I will say though is I'm usually busiest during the week so my weekday wardrobe is usually constructed with way more effort, whereas my weekend attire is often just pyjamas or comfy home clothes as I recover from the week that's just been.</p><p id=eTz30HSra1p data-wc=22><strong>Accessories can make or break an outfit. What are your must-have accessories, and how do you use them to elevate your look?</strong></p><p id=eDXNWjHbqZk data-wc=62>Ever since I shaved my head I have been really big on statement earrings. I tend not to wear makeup every day and the right earrings can immediately elevate your look. I feel the same with bags - I have quite an extensive bag collection and my obsession stems from the right bag's ability to completely change the vibe of an outfit</p><p id=e59OKWjF7Jm data-wc=26><strong>In the fashion world, trends are constantly evolving. How do you stay up-to-date with the latest fashion trends, and do you incorporate them into your wardrobe?</strong></p><p id=efZesmY-FU0 data-wc=50>The reality is, I don't! I have always just worn what I feel like, for better or worse. I will only ever incorporate trends if it's something that speaks to me, but since trend cycles are getting even shorter, I find myself re-wearing old pieces more than ever these days.&nbsp;</p><p id=ebITMABj0s1 data-wc=24><strong>Many people admire the way fashion insiders put together outfits effortlessly. Can you share some of your styling tips for mixing and matching pieces?</strong></p><p id=e02_zzhgoDk data-wc=55>I embrace matching as much as I do clashing - my family is Nigerian and culturally matching your shoes with your bag and details of your outfit is the done thing - I love how it pulls a look together. That being said, I'm really into gold and silver jewellery mixing, despite it being sacrilegious.&nbsp;</p><p id=e-IypfiGz2y data-wc=18><strong>Fashion insiders often attend high-profile events and parties. What's your strategy for creating memorable looks for evening parties?</strong></p><p id=epDnGXVuwbA data-wc=61>I usually style myself and whilst I wouldn't say I have a strategy per se, I am very open to experimentation which I think makes each look pretty memorable. They're all so distinct and it's not always the case that one person wears something wildly different on each occasion - I don't think people can necessarily predict what I'll wear next!</p><p id=ePOrJn6H2m9y data-wc=22><strong>The fashion industry can be demanding. How do you balance comfort and style when you have long days of meetings and appointments?&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=e4J0OqOpRGk5 data-wc=90>One word - Crocs. The ugly shoe renaissance has probably been one of my favourite things to happen within fashion over the past few years. I love a slip-on shoe, whether they're mules, clogs or Birkenstocks. But Crocs do have a special place in my heart and I have several pairs for different occasions. I even have a black pair from the Kurt Geiger collaboration with a fur trim, that I call my 'formal Crocs'! I've worn them to many a red carpet, and zhuzh them up with sparkly Jibbitz.&nbsp;</p><p id=eVfird1MlX data-wc=13><strong>&nbsp;will be published in paperback on April 25th - </strong><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>shop now</a><strong>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbOue8WaqqGhn6N6tb7Ep5usZ2VmhHp%2BlmiroZ1dm660tMiopWahnqi2pbHRZpuimaKuerq7zKJkmpyVnLyssY4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./518221-famous-female-cartoon-characters-time-ranked.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>30 famous female cartoon characters of all time, ranked</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./apps-learning-history.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>The 7 Best History Apps That Make Learning History Exciting</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./french-montanas-solid-wallet-explains-why-he-aint-worried-bout-nothin.html>French Montanas solid wallet explains why he Aint Worried Bout Nothin Tue 5 July 2022</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-jackson-new-album-songs-for-mother-daughters.html>Alan Jackson's New Album Features Songs for His Late Mother, More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-f1cf0f18-55b5-552e-a3b7-517c726ba35c-html.html>Eagles C Jason Kelce retires after 13 seasons | National</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65b82c73268e3ecb698b458b-html.html>Resultados Progol 2213: premios y quiniela ganadora del fin de semana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-cbd-products.html>What Is It, Is It Legal, And Will It Get You High?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib.
