She did it by revealing she is a lesbian and had been in a relationship with her partner&nbsp;Kathy Travis for a long span of seven years.</p><p>Orman first revealed that she was in love with her life partner when she divulged, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>“K.T. is my life partner. K.T. stands for Kathy Travis. We’re going on seven years. I have never been with a man in my whole life. I’m still a 55-year-old virgin.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p></p><p><strong>Caption: Suze Orman and her partner Kathy Travis, 2011.</strong> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Photo Credit: dailymail.co.uk</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Coming out and accepting her sexuality was an excellent thing to do on her part and everybody should respect her courage!</p><p>Now that we know that she is a lesbian and has a partner, we shed some light on their relationship. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>During an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview </a>back in 2016, she called her partner&nbsp;who she got married to in 2010&nbsp;"the light of her life," which shows that amount of love between them.</p><p>&nbsp;“I found KT at the age of 50, that was 15 years ago.

She keeps me going in ways that I never thought.”</p><p>Moreover, she expressed that getting married to Kathy was her biggest happiness. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>“the greatest joy was when we got married.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Though they met 16 years ago in 2001, the couple married in 2010 and have been happy ever since, with the book author saying that “the greatest joy was when we got married.”</p><p>The love Suze has for Kathy is unlimited, and she is so head over hills in her love that she would even <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">sacrifice all her money</a> if she had to choose between Kathy and her money. &nbsp;</p><p>“Ask me the question: ‘If you could keep all your money, or you could keep KT…? Bye-bye, money. Money, I could always make again. Will I ever find another KT? Never.”&nbsp;</p><p>That is amazing to know that the love between them is bigger than the love for their money and it is beautiful to watch what this wife and wife pair is willing to do for one another. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><strong>Caption: Suze Orman discusses her life and her relationship with her wife, Kathy.</strong></p><p>Video Credit: people.com</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Inspirational Suze And Her Net Worth:</h2><p>Not only is she a successful author, but she is also a financial adviser and is the very best at it.
