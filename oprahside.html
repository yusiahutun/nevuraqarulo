Who is OprahSide’s girlfriend?</p><h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2><p>OprahSide is a young up-and-coming YouTube gamer who hails from Chicago.</p><p>His self-titled YouTube channel is home to more than 2,000 videos that include vlogs, reactions, NBA 2K gameplay, NBA and college basketball game footage, and commentary.</p><p>He uses his secondary YouTube channel, Clark, to voice his opinion on issues affecting the black community, vlogs, and also promotes his custom tees, posters, and other merchandise.</p><p>Clark has over two million subscribers on the video streaming platform.</p><p>But what else do we know about the young—and extremely tall—YouTube personality?</p><h2><strong>The Origin Story</strong></h2><p><br>Clark William—the artist who would one day be known as OprahSide—was born on January 21, 1995, in Chicago, Illinois.</p><p>He was raised in the Windy City by middle-class parents and grew up playing basketball in high school.</p><p>Taller than most kids his age—as an adult he is 6’8—he appeared to be born for the sport.</p><p>Like most kids his age, he also developed a love of video games—especially the basketball kind.</p><p>When he wasn’t playing ball on his neighborhood court with friends, he was gaming.</p><p>At 19, he started sharing his love of basketball with the world via YouTube.</p><p>He uploaded his first video, a walkthrough of the young basketball enthusiast unlocking badges in NBA 2K15, in 2014.</p><h2><strong>Girlfriend</strong></h2><p>Clark “OprahSide” William is a fan of playing the court when it comes to women, too.</p><p>He’s only been linked to one woman seriously, while the rest have been flings or collaborations to boost viewership on his social media channels.</p><p>The one serious girlfriend he had was YouTube beauty, Mavi Malika.</p><p>Mavi has her own Instagram account and a small YouTube following.</p><p>Throughout most of 2018 and 2019, OprahSide featured or mentioned her in his videos, and celebrated his January birthday with the stunner that year.</p><p>The couple <a href=# rel=noopener>shared video</a> of their celebration trip and crazy hotel antics on his channel.</p><p>The relationship was definitely the on / off kind, with Mavi accusing him of cheating multiple times, and OprahSide posting a break-up video not long before they got back together.</p><h2><strong>The Off-Court Career</strong></h2><p><br>OprahSide began uploading NBA 2K15 videos to YouTube for fun, just before he turned 20.</p><p>The game had already garnered a lot of attention, so OprahSide’s foray into the YouTube world was well-timed.</p><p>As his subscriber count grew, so did his commitment to YouTube as a legitimate career.</p><p>Deciding to ditch the traditional route and find a real job, he began uploading more consistently and looking at ways to grow his fanbase.</p><p>His NBA commentary videos earned him a big surge in followers.</p><p>With his personal style and fresh take on player performance and team tactics, he became popular enough to start a second channel that also netted more than 500,000 subscribers by 2021.</p><p>Some of his most popular series include his IRL Basketball Videos—one of which shows him hit a nearly-half court shot with ease.</p><p>His storytime videos also draw a crowd, as he delivers his apparently “IRL” experiences with humor and honesty.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Chris Moneymaker & Christina Wren</a></p><h2><strong>Almost a GQ Feature</strong></h2><p><br>In 2019, OprahSide posted a video titled 10 Things Clark Can’t Live Without | GQ.</p><p>The video amassed almost half a million views, but wasn’t really hosted by GQ at all.</p><p>The prank video features OprahSide, who calls himself Clark and OSN in the video, listing 10 things he can’t live without.</p><p>In the video, he showcases his Yves Saint Laurent fragrance, which he says he likes because it’s under $100 but it’s got the YSL brand so it sounds fancy.</p><p>He also talks about headphones, and says his favorite line is the Beats by Dre Pro—but they aren’t wireless. He also recommends the Bose wireless over-ear headphones.</p><p>At one point in the video, he also carries on a conversation with himself, pretending someone off-camera asked him who his favorite artist is. He lists Kanye, Da Baby, Lil Uzi Vert, and Lil Wayne.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Michael Youssef Net Worth</a></p><h2><strong>OprahSide – Net Worth</strong></h2><p>So, how much is OprahSide worth?&nbsp;William earned most of his wealth from ads on YouTube and sponsors.
