Oh, you can certainly give it a shot — and people have — but it’s only a matter of time before the first family of horror comedy comes back, as they’re preparing to do now with a <a href=#>reboot on NBC</a>! Their longevity, of course, is not completely surprising considering this particular family dynamic.</p><p><a href=#>MORE: Karen Walker’s First Line in the ‘Will & Grace’ Reboot Is So Karen Walker</a></p><p>The grandfather (“Grandpa”) is a vampire, as is his daughter, Lily, who is married to a variation of the Frankenstein monster, Herman. Their son, Eddie “Wolfgang” Munster, is a werewolf, and they have a beautiful, perfectly normal niece named Marilyn, who is considered the freak of the family. Sounds insane, doesn’t it? But let’s face it, the 1960s were a wacky time for comedies, when writers and producers would throw whatever came to mind out there and see what would stick. And, man, the things that did.</p><h2>Let’s revisit wacky shows of the 1960s…</h2><p>There was the advertising exec who fell in love with and married a witch (Bewitched), the astronaut stranded on a desert island who was rescued by, and began a relationship with, a genie in a bottle (I Dream of Jeannie), the guy whose late mother came back to him — as his 1928 Porter car (My Mother the Car), a comedy about life in a Nazi POW camp during World War II — if you can even imagine such a thing now (Hogan’s Heroes), the martian who came to visit and wouldn’t leave (My Favorite Martian), a nun whose habit allowed her to fly (The Flying Nun), and a talking horse, of course, of course (Mr. Ed). And then, again, there was The Munsters, which looks like it just may outlive them all.</p><p>As reported by <a href=#>Deadline</a>, Odd Mom Out creator Jill Kargman and Late Night host Seth Meyers are currently developing this new take that will see the Munsters clan actually relocate from 1313 Mockingbird Lane in California to “hipster” Brooklyn, New York. It will be interesting to see that culture clash.</p><p>The Munsters only ran for two seasons on CBS beginning in 1964, but has remained alive in reruns ever since. The original show starred Fred Gwynne as Herman, Yvonne De Carlo as Lily, Al Lewis as Grandpa, Butch Patrick as Eddie, and both Beverley Owen and Pat Priest as Marilyn. In its final year, it spawned a big-screen version called Munster, Go Home, which took the family to London following the death of a relative.</p><p><a href=#>MORE: ABC President Reveals How the ‘Roseanne’ Reboot Will Explain the Show’s Wacky Series Finale</a></p><p>In 1973, ABC aired a forgettable (you don’t remember it, do you?) animated film called The Mini-Munsters, for which only Al Lewis provided the voice to his character; however, Lewis, Gwynne, and De Carlo came back together for the live action 1981 TV movie The Munsters’ Revenge. In it, the owner of a wax museum creates robots of Herman and Grandpa that are used to commit robberies. (Yeah, we don’t really get that one, either.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/the-munsters-reboot.jpg><p>The original Munsters cast in 1964. (Photo Credit: Getty Images)</p><p>From 1988-91, audiences were given 72 episodes of The Munsters Today. It seems the family had been asleep in Grandpa’s lab for 22 years and, reawakened, now had to try and fit into a whole new world. The stars of this one were John Schuck as Herman, Lee Meriwether as Lily, Howard Morton as Grandpa, Jason Marsden as Eddie, and Hilary Van Dyke as Marilyn. Another one lost to the mists of time (not necessarily a bad thing).</p><h2>The Munsters have always been TV’s first family of horror</h2><p>In 1995, we saw the release of the TV movie Here Come The Munsters, which served as a prequel to the original show. After being persecuted by the people of Transylvania, the family learns about their niece Marilyn in California and decides to relocate. This one featured Edward Herrmann (Gilmore Girls) as Herman, Veronica Hamel as Lily, Robert Morse as Grandpa, Christine Taylor as Marilyn, and Matthew Botuchis as Eddie.</p><p><a href=#>MORE: ‘Roseanne’ Reboot Looking to Add “Gender Creative” Character to Storyline</a></p><p>Most recently, there was the TV movie Mockingbird Lane that was designed to be the pilot for a new TV series. This one was different from the others — if it had gone to series, it would have been an hour-long dramedy produced by Bryan Fuller (American Gods, Star Trek: Discovery). Now, seriously, have you ever watched an episode of The Munsters and wondered what it would be like if it was a dramatic show? It didn’t work with The Bradys in the 90s and it didn’t seem likely to work here. Interesting casting, though —&nbsp;Jerry O’Connell was Herman, Porta de Rossi was Lily, Charity Wakefield was Marilyn, Mason Cook was Eddie, and Eddie Izzard was Grandpa. Deciding not to go with a series, NBC aired it as a Halloween TV movie in 2012 instead.</p><h2>The modern show should be just as awesome!</h2><p>The new version from Meyers and Kargman returns to The Munsters’ roots by turning it back into a 30-minute sitcom. You’d think after all these incarnations, there’d be no more room for Munsters mania — but you’d be wrong. The beauty of the franchise is that in the proper hands it can easily adapt to changing times, nicely commenting on the world around us. And they can get away with pretty much anything they want, because the comments are coming from monsters… uh, Munsters. So watch out, Brooklyn —&nbsp;here comes Herman and the gang, and we can’t wait!</p><p>This story originally appeared on our sister site, <a href=#>Woman’s World</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46tn55lnaq7tMDEq6pmqpWXvLDAjGpqcm5ja3w%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tommy-davidson-rock-bottom-red-table-talk.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tommy Davidson Recalls Hitting Rock Bottom on Red Table Talk About Addiction</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-china-hubs-san-fran-nebraska-houston-suspected-working-beijing-manhattan-bust-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The China hubs in San Fran, Nebraska, Houston suspected of working for Beijing after Manhattan bust</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./french-montanas-solid-wallet-explains-why-he-aint-worried-bout-nothin.html>French Montanas solid wallet explains why he Aint Worried Bout Nothin Tue 5 July 2022</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-jackson-new-album-songs-for-mother-daughters.html>Alan Jackson's New Album Features Songs for His Late Mother, More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-f1cf0f18-55b5-552e-a3b7-517c726ba35c-html.html>Eagles C Jason Kelce retires after 13 seasons | National</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65b82c73268e3ecb698b458b-html.html>Resultados Progol 2213: premios y quiniela ganadora del fin de semana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-cbd-products.html>What Is It, Is It Legal, And Will It Get You High?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib.
