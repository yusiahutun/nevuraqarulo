Daniel Kwan took some time after accepting the Oscar for best original screenplay to thank his wife from the podium. “My wife, who protects me every day from the most negative thoughts I have, especially when I’m writing,” Daniel said, as the camera cut to her sitting in the audience.</p><p>Below you can explore details related to their relationship, her age, career, and more. So keep scrolling down to learn more about Kirsten as you this article proceeds.</p><h3><strong>Meet Kirsten Lepore, Daniel Kwan Wife</strong></h3><p>Daniel Kwan, who famously directed Everything Everywhere All at Once along with Daniel Scheinert, is currently married to his wife Kristen Lepore. On Valentines Day 2020, Daniel shared that he met Kirsten almost 10 years before.</p><p>Kirsten and Daniel met in Los Angeles, “kind of online but through mutual friends” in animation.</p><p>“I just commented on a Facebook video of them all hanging out,” Lepore says. “And then my animator friend from London was like, ‘You should meet this guy. He lives in LA. He’s really cool.’ So then we all met — me, Daniel, and the other Daniel. We had a fantastic time. We all became fast friends.” At first, when Daniel showed interest in something more, Kirsten “friend-zoned” him.</p><p id=WALHMA4PHRHRHGJ2ZOU6O5QDRY class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left">“It took about a year before I saw him in a new light, and we actually started dating,” she said. <span>They got engaged on New Year’s Day 2015 which Daniel announced via an </span><a href=#>IG post</a><span>.</span></p><p>Kirsten and Daniel exchanged their wedding vows on 25 August 2016. He broke the news with a pic that wasn’t from their wedding day.</p><p>Dan wrote, “I’m not ready to post an actual picture of the wedding because I don’t think I’ll be able to come up with a caption that will do it justice. I will probably never have the words to describe the insanely transcendent rocket ship made of clouds we found ourselves on the day we got married, but it was one of those rare times where life exceeds all expectations and gives you a wholly new experience.”</p><p>The married couple celebrated their honeymoon in Japan.</p><p>On Mother’s Day 2022, Daniel wished his wife, “Who would I be without her? What would he be without her? Kirsten is one of those rare humans who excels at everything she tries. I always say she is the most impressive person I have ever met. But few things impress me more than watching her with our son. A mix of transcendent levels of patience and Giving Tree levels of selflessness. Our son is going to grow up thinking mothers are capable of anything. I feel beyond lucky that I get to be the one raising him with her. Happy Mother’s Day.”</p><p>Speaking with NJ.com, Kirsten also gushed about her husband stating, “He’s a constant source of inspiration, for sure. Very mischievous and gets into a lot of things he’s not supposed to, kind of like Groot does — makes a lot of messes, as toddlers do. There are things every day that come up that either remind me of something I’ve already written for Groot or things that my son has done that have informed some story ideas entirely.”</p><p>The married couple shares one son named Gio Lepore Kwan. Gio turned 4 years old in February 2023. On his 3rd birthday, Daniel wished his son, “<span>Our beautiful goober is 3 today. </span><span>Happy birthday to the only 3-year-old who screams when they get sprinkler heads and solar landscaping lights for their birthday.”</span></p><h3><strong>Kirsten Lepore Age</strong></h3><p>Kirsten Lepore is 38 years old.
