The “Flowers” songstress released her new album <a href=# id=auto-tag_endless-summer-vacation data-tag=endless-summer-vacation>Endless Summer Vacation</a> on March 10, 2023 and the seventh track in her words is “nasty.”</p><p>The Hannah Montana alum explained that her new album is split into two parts, with River starting the second part as the P.M. part. “In the nighttime, it feels that there’s a slinky, seediness, and kind of a grime, but a glamor at the same time. In the evening, it’s a great time for rest, it’s a time to recover — or, it’s a time to go out and experience the wild side,” she said in her Disney Plus special “The Backyard Sessions”in March 2023. “In L.A. there’s a certain energy to the night that you can kind of feel trouble boil up to the surface and it’s very inspiring to me.”</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/taylor-swift-setlist.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/taylor-swift-tickets.jpg><p>So what do <a href=# rel=noopener>Miley Cyrus’ “River” lyrics</a> mean? And are they about <a href=# id=auto-tag_liam-hemsworth data-tag=liam-hemsworth>Liam Hemsworth</a>?

When she was teasing out the album, Miley went in depth about the song in her Disney Plus special “The <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Backyard Sessions</a>” in March 2023. “It was a time in my life where I was going through just a lot emotionally and personally, and I guess all my songs kind of evolve,” she said. “They can start as something that was a trouble, like, it just feels like it’s an April shower. It never stops raining. And then it started raining down like love.”</p><p>She continued in the special, <span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">“</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-b88u0q r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">River</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"> sometimes we just need to dance for a banger a.k.a they dont want me to talk about how the fact the song is about,” the clip cuts out with a censor bleep. “It’s f—ing nasty.”</span></p><p>Fans theorized that it bleep censored out the word for ejaculation, while others also kept on the theory that it might be about her ex-husband Liam Hemsworth and his cheating scandals.</p><p>A fan <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">tweeted out</a>, “miley cyrus has filmed her newest <a href=# id=auto-tag_music-2 data-tag=music-2>music</a> video for ‘RIVER’ in the same house of the Flowers video but with 14 men, 14 as the number of women that liam cheated on her with..she’s MESSY 😭” In the music video, it shows Miley dancing around 14 men in a black and white background.</p><p>Though like the “Flowers” <a href=# rel=noopener>music video</a> theories, the reports are unverified. However, that doesn’t mean the possibilities aren’t there. The music video for the lead single from Endless Summer Vacation “Flowers” was an instant hit. Pop culture Twitter PopTingz claimed that the set of the<a href=# rel=noopener>&nbsp;music video</a>&nbsp;was where Hemsworth allegedly cheated on Cyrus with 14 women. “The house where the music video for Miley Cyrus’ “Flowers” was recorded was previously used by Liam Hemsworth to cheat on Miley with more than 14 women while they were married,” the account tweeted, but the tweet itself is unverified. The tweet went viral with more than 40,000 likes and 10,000 retweets.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/miley-cyrus-river.png><p>Liam and Miley were in an on-and-off relationship since 2009 when they met on the set of The Last Song. In one instance in an interview with Howard Stern, Miley also revealed that she didn’t think her and Hemsworth would ever&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tie the knot</a>. “We were together since 16,” she said.&nbsp; “Our house burned down. We had been like, engaged—I don’t know if we really ever thought we were actually going to get married, but when we lost our house in Malibu—which if you listen to my voice pre- and post-fire, they’re very different so that trauma really affected my voice. And I was actually in South Africa, so I couldn’t come home, and like, my animals were tied to a post at the beach. I lost everything.”</p><p>She continued to talk about her relationship with Hemsworth with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Howard Stern</a>&nbsp;in December 2020. “Me being an intense person and not wanting to sit with it and not wanting to go, you know, ‘What could be purposeful about this?’ I just clung to what I had left of that house, which was me and him,” she told Stern. “And I really do and did love him very, very, very much and still do, always will.”</p><p>Miley and Liam<a href=# rel=noopener>&nbsp;married in 2018</a>&nbsp;and announced their split less than a year later in 2019. The couple definitely had their ups and downs—including a pretty disastrous experience in late 2018, when California wildfires wiped out their home in Malibu. Cyrus told Howard Stern that she and the 30-year-old&nbsp;Hunger Games&nbsp;star “lost everything.” Miley references the disaster in the first verse “We were right ’til we weren’t / Built a home and watched it burn.” In an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Rolling Stone</a>&nbsp;in 2020, she revealed that the fire “did what I couldn’t do myself”. “It removed me from what no longer was serving its purpose,” she told the magazine. “And then as you drown, you reach for that lifesaver and you want to save yourself. I think that’s really what, ultimately, getting married was for me. One last attempt to save myself.”</p><p>The Bangerz singer denied the cheating rumors when she was fresh out of the divorce. &nbsp;In August 2019, she <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">tweeted,</a>&nbsp;“The truth is, once Liam & I reconciled, I meant it, & I was committed. There are NO secrets to uncover here. I’ve learned from every experience in my life. I’m not perfect, I don’t want to be, it’s boring. I’ve grown up in front of you, but the bottom line is, I HAVE GROWN UP. I can admit to a lot of things but I refuse to admit that my marriage ended because of cheating. Liam and I have been together for a decade. I’ve said it before & it remains true, I love Liam and always will.” She continued, “BUT at this point, I had to make a healthy decision for myself to leave a previous life behind. I am the healthiest and happiest I have been in a long time. You can say I am a twerking, pot-smoking, foul-mouthed hillbilly but I am not a liar.”</p><h2>Miley Cyrus “River” lyrics</h2><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p>Here are Miley Cyrus’ River lyrics via <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Genius.</a></p><p>[Verse 1]<br>I got a new dress just to meet you downtown<br>Can you walk me through the park just to show it off?<br>I can pull my hair back in that tight way that you like<br>If you wrap me in your arms and never stop</p><p>[Pre-Chorus]<br>Heart beats so loud that it’s drownin’ me out<br>Livin’ in an April shower<br>You’re pourin’ down, baby, drown me out (Ooh, ooh, ooh)</p><p>[Chorus]<br><span class="ReferentFragmentdesktop__Highlight-sc-110r0d9-1 jAzSMw">You’re just like a river (Ooh, ooh, ooh)<br>You’re just like a river (Ooh, ooh, ooh)<br>You go on forever<br>You’re just like a river</span></p><p>[Verse 2]<br><span class="ReferentFragmentdesktop__Highlight-sc-110r0d9-1 jAzSMw">Blowing bubbles in the bath, I can’t stop from thinking lately<br>You could be the one, have the honor of my babies<br>Hope they have your eyes and that crooked smile<br>Was a desеrt ‘fore I met you, I was in a drought</span></p><p>[Pre-Chorus]<br>Heart bеats so loud that it’s drownin’ me out<br>Livin’ in an April shower<br>You’re pourin’ down, baby, drown me out (Ooh, ooh, ooh)</p><p>[Chorus]<br><span class="ReferentFragmentdesktop__Highlight-sc-110r0d9-1 jAzSMw">You’re just like a river (Ooh, ooh, ooh)<br>You’re just like a river (Ooh, ooh, ooh)<br>You go on forever<br>You’re just like a river</span></p><p>[Post-Chorus]<br><span class="ReferentFragmentdesktop__Highlight-sc-110r0d9-1 jAzSMw">You’re never runnin’ dry (Oh)</span></p><p>[Bridge]<br>I feel you everywhere<br>Your face is all in my hair (Hair)<br>Covered up in your sweat<br>It turns me on that you care, baby<br>Your love, it flows just like a river</p><p>[Chorus]<br><span class="ReferentFragmentdesktop__Highlight-sc-110r0d9-1 jAzSMw">You’re just like a river (That’s what you are)<br>You’re just like a river (That’s what you are)<br>You’re just like a river (That’s what you are)<br>You’re just like a river<br>You’re just like a river (Heart beats so loud that it’s drownin’ me out)<br>You’re just like a river (Livin’ in an April shower)<br>You go on forever (You’re pourin’ down, baby, drown me out)<br>You’re just like a river</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/endless-summer-vacation-miley-cyrus.jpg><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
