The day before her flight home Sue experienced severe abdominal pain and a high fever. The next morning, she sought help at Matilda International Hospital and after some blood tests and a CT scan, a mass was found in her abdomen. The doctor’s advice was to have surgery as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Naturally, Sue wanted to get a second opinion before the surgery, “I wanted to see if I could get well enough to get on a plane and deal with this back at home in the UK. The doctors were extremely patient when they explained everything to me. It was clear though that I was very ill and I knew the chips were down, leaving no options.” Surgery took place the next day.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sue had been through two similar episodes before, 6 and 13 years ago. The first time required hospital treatment but with second episode she improved with help from her GP so didn’t follow up further. This time, an abscess formed from a ruptured diverticulitis in her bowel.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/660w/public/d8/images/2019/08/12/141846_mih_ruptured_diverticulitis_drawing_3_op.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sue was diagnosed with diverticulitis, where one or more of the diverticula (small, bulging pouches that can form in the lining of the digestive system, usually in the colon), had become inflamed then ruptured forming an abscess. This explained the severe abdominal pain, fever, nausea and changes in bowel movements. Diverticula are quite common among people over 40, though seldom cause problems. Simple diverticulitis can be treated with antibiotics, however with severe or recurrent complications, surgery is usually recommended.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sue underwent a laparoscopic right hemicolectomy performed by Dr Edward Lai, and Dr Benny Fok at Matilda International Hospital to have the inflamed part of the colon removed through small incisions in the abdomen. It meant a weeklong hospital stay before she was well enough to be discharged but she could not have been happier with the experience under the circumstances.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The team at Matilda was just fabulous and very patient. I was wheeled out every day to get fresh air and enjoy the beautiful views from the Peak. The physiotherapist came every day to help me recover. The doctors saw me every day, nurses including those who weren’t on my case would come to visit and even the housekeeping staff made sure that I was comfortable. I couldn’t have gotten better attention,” Sue remembered.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/660w/public/d8/images/2019/08/12/at_hospital.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It was the friendly and genuine care of the staff that helped the&nbsp;Nixons&nbsp;through this difficult time. Malcolm and their son Charles spent a lot of time at the hospital, and the family celebrated Charles’ birthday with a picnic on the grounds.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/660w/public/d8/images/2019/08/12/family.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sue especially appreciated the hospital’s wide range of international cuisines. Though her diet was initially restricted due to her condition the rest of her family enjoyed hotel style meals.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The little things mean a lot, but it was the emotional support the family received that helped them through the most. An emergency like this puts considerable strain on the spouse and family of the patient and even though the family was close and the couple had been married for 47 years, the Nixons admitted it was a trying time.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Just before the operation I realised what a crisis this might be, that it could leave me alone without her. The manager of the ward was very supportive of me as a person and took me to a private room to talk me through the outcomes. Everyone at the hospital was very compassionate and understanding. They recognised that I was going through a big emotional challenge and kept finding me and Charles to make sure that we were okay.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Now back in the UK, Sue said looking back she felt fortunate that this happened in Hong Kong and is now focusing on making a full recovery.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/660w/public/d8/images/2019/08/12/w2902_01_1184_lowres.jpg><a rel=nofollow class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Matilda International Hospital</span></a> provides comprehensive care for patients undergoing a wide range of surgeries.
