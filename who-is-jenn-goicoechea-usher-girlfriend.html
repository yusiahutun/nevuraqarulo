The intimate 30-person ceremony took place at Vegas Weddings’ Terrace Gazebo, with Usher’s mom, Jonnetta Patton, serving as the witness, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/usher-marries-longtime-girlfriend-jennifer-goicoechea-las-vegas-wedding-exclusive-8575794 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">People</a> reported.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“We can confirm that Usher and Jennifer Goicoechea took the next step in their relationship and did get married on Sunday night in Las Vegas, surrounded by close friends and family,” the singer’s rep told People. “They both look forward to continuing to raise their children together, surrounded by love, and thank everyone for the well-wishes.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Like the “Yeah!” hitmaker, Goicoechea is in the music industry and has been making her own waves on the R&B and hip-hop scene for years. The power couple’s romance is truly the product of love songs, from their very first photo together, in 2016, to the birth of their second child, in 2021.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In November 2023, Usher gushed about his relationship with Goicoechea to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/usher-calls-girlfriend-jennifer-goicoechea-my-best-friend-exclusive-8391799 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>People</u></a>, saying, “I’m very happy, very fortunate to have an incredible friend, not just a partner. She’s my best friend and I love her.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Read on for everything we know about Goicoechea.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">She works in the music industry, too.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Goicoechea is a Miami native born to an Italian mother and a Puerto Rican father. She studied recording arts at Full Sail University in Winter Park, Florida, and got a taste of the entertainment industry when she shadowed her mom, who was director of operations at global production agency ACT Productions. That led to her landing a job as an assistant for Grammy-winning singer Ciara.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">From there, Goicoechea moved to California and opened Boogs’N’Effect Management. In 2014, she became the director of the Rhythm & Soul (Urban) division at ASCAP; she joined Sony Music Entertainment’s Epic Records, where she currently works, as senior vice president of A&R in 2016. In 2020 and 2021, she was recognized as one of Billboard’s R&B/Hip-Hop Power Players. Throughout her career, she has worked with big names including Stunna Girl, DJ Khaled, and 21 Savage.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Jenn and Usher have known each other a long time.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While it remains a mystery just how the two became acquainted, they have known each other for quite some time. Goicoechea first shared a photo of herself and the singer in 2016; in it, she is seen whispering in his ear. “Not sure what I’m saying or who I’m speaking too 🙄😂 But my nails look good 💅🏼😜,” she wrote in the caption.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She shared another photo of herself with Usher in 2018, this one captioned, “Boys Club.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The pair sparked rumors of romance when they were photographed together at record producer Keith Thomas’s birthday celebration in Atlanta in June 2019. They sealed the deal a few months later, when they were photographed kissing backstage at the Hollywood Bowl in October 2019. And they made their official debut in <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.ajc.com/entertainment/usher-and-girlfriend-jenn-goicoechea-snuggle-diddy-50th-birthday-bash/xhGTrSY0XVe9SPiAddWCqO/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="December 2019" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>December 2019</u></a>, when they attended Sean “Diddy” Combs’s birthday in Los Angeles, where Usher was performing.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">They have two kids.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Goicoechea and Usher welcomed their first child, daughter Sovereign Bo, on September 24, 2020. The singer commemorated the news with an Instagram photo of her tiny baby hand wrapped around his fingers, captioned, “We are feeling blessed and full of love with the arrival of our beautiful baby girl, Sovereign Bo Raymond. ‘Isn’t She Lovely’ by Stevie Wonder on repeat.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Almost exactly a year later, Goicoechea gave birth to their second child, a boy named Sire Castrello. Once again, Usher took to Instagram, posting a close-up of his son’s face with the caption “Hi my name is Sire Castrello Raymond … I am the newest addition to the Raymond crew. I was born Sept 29 2021 at 6:42pm weighing 7lbs 13oz. Hear me roar … A.K.A Ra Ra .👶🏽 ♎️Gang #demraymondboys.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Usher also shares two sons with ex-wife Tameka Foster: Usher “Cinco” V, 16, and Naviyd Ely, 15.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/d41b366c-0c5e-4fd4-85f9-ab612540d1c4_1701099318.png alt="Headshot of Christina Perrier" title="Headshot of Christina Perrier" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Christina Perrier is a NYC-based freelance writer who covers culture and lifestyle topics.
