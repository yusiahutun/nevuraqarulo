She is a child. You are supposed to be a grown up. I don't think you comprehend what you have done to my family." The person Sarah claims is Ryan then replied, "And she acts like a little bitch, just like you. So you can both get f--ked!"</p><p>Sarah has three older children who don't belong to Ryan, so it's unclear which child was being discussed in the messages; however, when someone in the comments section asked, "Is he saying this about his own daughter?"

What's going on?"</p><p>"Calling her daughter a name?" Tamra asked, "Wait, their daughter or her daughter?" Andy didn't know.</p><p>"I don't know," Tamra said, "but Sarah tends to go on social media and posts all this stuff, then delete it, so I'm not buying into it."</p><p>And that was that.</p><p>In July 2018, Tamra confirmed on "WWHL" that Ryan and his one-time fiancée were "not together anymore. They just share custody of Ava."</p><p>During a 2017 episode of "RHOC," Tamra and Ryan spoke candidly about his relationship with the mother of his only child. Using his hand to demonstrate a wave-like motion, Ryan said he and Sarah were having their "ups and downs, I guess."</p><p>"The fighting that goes on doesn't need to happen," Tamra said, which Ryan said he understood. He recalled his rocky relationship with his stepfather/Tamra's ex-husband, Simon Barney, saying, "I do relate to the guy in my current situation. And I even spoke highly of him the other day, which is a trip."</p><p>"To the girls, they weren't doing any of their chores," Ryan told his mom, before starting to cry. "I said, 'You know what, girls? I had a stepdad that was an asshole. But I do thank him.'"</p><p>Back when Ryan first told his mom he had become engaged to a girl he met on Instagram, Sarah, Tamra was less than pleased. But Tamra and Sarah, who lost both her parents shortly before meeting Ryan, eventually became "super close."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:612763b3-96d6-5109-892a-78b39a8a95be data-container-ref=toofab:article:9392a6e2-6c9e-5f24-9bda-f679a3622ef6 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/a8/5by4/2019/08/06/a878b527165c510182bb4ffee05a497c_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Bravo/Instagram/Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">'RHOC' Recap: Gina Deals with DUI Arrest, Tamra Faces 'Fanatic Trump Supporter' Son on Season 14 Premiere</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>In 2016, she told Bravo's Daily Dish that Ryan and Sarah were "a day-to-day thing. They're doing good today. They went to Disneyland with Ava yesterday. But it's up and down, and it's tiring, frustrating, and I just want them to get it together."</p><p>"Sarah and I are super close, and we're more like friends than the mother-daughter relationship," she explained. "So Sarah tends to tell me a lot of things that are going on in their relationship, which kind of at times I'm like, 'Oh, jeez, I don't think I want to know this.' Like, 'I don't need to know about every single fight.' But she doesn't have a lot of people out here, and she doesn't have a mom or a dad, so I've really stepped in."</p><p>This season, Tamra and <strong><a href=#>"fanatic Trump supporter" Ryan</a></strong> have been butting heads over the latter's political disputes with his younger brother, Spencer Barney.</p><p>"The Real Housewives of Orange County" airs Tuesdays at 9 p.m. on Bravo.</p><p><strong>Got a story or a tip for us?
