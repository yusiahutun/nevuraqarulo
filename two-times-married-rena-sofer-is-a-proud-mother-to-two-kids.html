Whilst a lot of us might not relate to it, there's someone special who does.</p><p>Do allow us to introduce the stunner i.e. <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Rena Sofer</strong></a> who has been engaged thrice but to two people. Say what? It sure does sound a bit complex, but wait till you hear about the whole story of the actress that will leave you in utter awe at the end. You might, in fact, get ready with your popcorns before you start.</p><h2>Rena Sofer Meets Sanford Bookstaver In 2001</h2><p>Well, yes, the General Hospital actress has been engaged twice to her former husband and current fiance, <strong>Sanford Bookstaver</strong>, director and producer known for his work for Chicago Fire, One Tree Hill, and Prison Break starring <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Wentworth Miller</strong></a>.</p><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2020/02/09/rena-sofer-pictured-with-her-daughters-and-partner-sanford-bookstaver--1581250147.png width=450 height=461 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><strong><span class=imageCaption>Rena Sofer pictured with her daughters and partner, Sanford Bookstaver. </span><span class=imageSource>SOURCE: Rena Sofer Instagram</span></strong><p>Sofer first met her long-term partner in 2001 on the set of The Chronicles where the actress portrayed the role of <strong>Grace Hall</strong>, three years after divorcing her first husband. Romance then instantly flourished between Rena and Sanford.</p><p>And, nearly two years later in August 2002, Bookstaver popped the question in a dramatic movie style. And, for the engagement, the New York-born director played smart and made sure all the plans went accordingly.</p><h2>The Cinematic Engagement Of Sofer & Bookstaver</h2><p>Sanford started the action by pretending to be mad at his then-girlfriend and started an argument for not spending enough time with his friends. For the second step, Sanford invited the Blind Justice alum to a hotel for a party organized for one of his friends.</p><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2020/02/09/rena-sofer-and-sanford-became-engaged-in-august-2002--1581250019.jpg width=450 height=535 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><strong><span class=imageCaption>Rena Sofer and Sanford became engaged in August 2002. </span><span class=imageSource>SOURCE: Zimbio</span></strong><p>Completely unaware of what awaited ahead of her, Rena reaches the hotel. Of course, Bookstaver is the one to open the room which then greets the actress with hundreds of ignited candles and roses. The next thing she knows, Sanford is on his knees and lays up his finger with a platinum ring encrusted with a three-carat diamond.</p><p>Overwhelmed with the scenario, Rena says 'yes' with tears forming in her eyes. The following day, the sweet and considerate Bookstaver also asks <strong>Rosabel Rosalind Kurth</strong>, Sofer's child with her first husband actor <strong>Wally Kurth&nbsp;</strong>if she would want him as her step-father.</p><p>Needless to say, a wedding was only stopping these three to become one big happy family.</p><h2>Sofer and Bookstaver Says 'I Do'</h2><p>The love birds were indeed going stronger a year later, as on the beautiful day of 18th May 2003, the celebrity pair rented a ranch in Malibu to exchange their marital vows in front of eighty guests including <strong>Carolyn Hinsey</strong>, Sofer's bridesmaids.</p><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2020/02/09/rena-sofer-and-sanford-bookstaver-tied-the-knot-in-malibu-in-2003--1581249904.jpg width=450 height=563 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><strong><span class=imageCaption>Rena Sofer and Sanford Bookstaver tied the knot in Malibu in 2003. </span><span class=imageSource>SOURCE: Sanford Bookstaver Instagram</span></strong><p>And, for their wedding planned by <strong>Yifat Oren</strong> and officiated by the brides' father, <strong>Martin Sofer</strong>, Bookstaver opted to rock a black tuxedo by <strong>Armani</strong> with a <strong>James Bonds</strong> styled shade whilst his bride looked happy in a white gown designed by <strong>Badgley Mischka</strong>.</p><p>Their reception likewise was equally lavish where the guests enjoyed the scrumptious taste of Chinese dumplings, Tootsie Pops, burgers and Tuscan chicken along with a martini bar to celebrate Sanford's love for Bond.</p><p>Their love could be so felt by the guests that Hinsey shared the bride and groom were too happy that they wouldn't have cared if the skies opened up and struck them with lightning.</p><h2>The Couple Divorces 13 Years Later</h2><p>Two years later on 5th August 2005, Sofer and Bookstaver welcomed their first and only child, a daughter named <strong>Avalon Leone Bookstaver</strong> who is nine years junior to Rosabel, born in 1996.</p><p>Things went completely fine for the couple until 2016 when their marriage hit the rock bottom as Rena and Sanford filed for divorce. Their divorce was big enough news to cause headlines. The former couple still decided to remain friends to raise their children together.</p><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2020/02/09/rena-sofer-flaunts-her-engagement-gift-given-by-her-husband-turned-fiance-sanford-bookstaver--1581249760.png width=450 height=501 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><strong><span class=imageCaption>Rena Sofer flaunts her engagement gift given by her husband turned fiance, Sanford Bookstaver. </span><span class=imageSource>SOURCE: Rena Sofer Instagram</span></strong><p>But, interestingly, it must have been in those distance when Rena and Sanford realized the missing piece from the puzzle was none other than the person who has been beside them all these times.</p><p>And, in Valentine 2019, news broke that the duo reconciled their relationship when Rena shared on Instagram asking the love of his life to be her Valentine forever. Fans were quick to congratulate them.</p><p>Three months later, Sanford then popped the question again to the NCIS star to spend the rest of her life with him. Both the couple took to Instagram to share the big news with the fans learning that the producer gifted a golden Cartier love bracelet as a token of love to celebrate his fiancee.</p><h2>Sofer's History With Wally Kurth</h2><p>The mother of two was married to Mr. Kurth for more than two years from 1995 till 1997. Their romance sparked after they met for the first time on the set of one of ABC's longest-running soap opera, General Hospital where Sofer worked from 1993 till 1997.</p><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2020/02/09/rena-sofer-married-general-hospital-co-star-wally-kurth-in-1995--1581249601.jpg width=450 height=555 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><strong><span class=imageCaption>Rena Sofer married General Hospital co-star, Wally Kurth in 1995. </span><span class=imageSource>SOURCE: Pinterest</span></strong><p>Whilst Sofer played the role of <strong>Lois Cerullo</strong> in the hit series, her former husband portrayed the recurring role of <strong>Ned Ashton</strong>. Taking their romance to the next level, Sofer and Wally tied the knot on March 31st, 1995.</p><p>Unfortunately, their marriage was then tested with challenges which they couldn't succeed to pass. Sofer and Kurth eventually divorced in 1997.</p><p>As of Feb 2020, Rena and Sanford who happily reside in their LA-based <strong>$1.9 million</strong> mansions are still yet to tie the knot.</p><p>See more <a href=# rel=noopener>Stories</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Biographies</a> only on <a href=# rel=noopener>Marriedwiki.com</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDsKCkoV6YvK57wKuropucmny1w85mq6Kllah6rq3Rq6CenF2nsq%2BtjKymn52iYra0ecBmp6unpZl6rrvToZyrZaSkerXDzmaiopyj</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./virgil-van-dijk-carabao-message-32212930.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Virgil van Dijk has 'cold' message for haters after winning Liverpool the Carabao Cup</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./katie-holmes-reveals-daughter-with-tom-cruise-suri-reaction-to-career.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise's daughter Suri reacted to her mom's &amp;quot;Dawson's Creek&amp;quot; role</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./french-montanas-solid-wallet-explains-why-he-aint-worried-bout-nothin.html>French Montanas solid wallet explains why he Aint Worried Bout Nothin Tue 5 July 2022</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-jackson-new-album-songs-for-mother-daughters.html>Alan Jackson's New Album Features Songs for His Late Mother, More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-f1cf0f18-55b5-552e-a3b7-517c726ba35c-html.html>Eagles C Jason Kelce retires after 13 seasons | National</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65b82c73268e3ecb698b458b-html.html>Resultados Progol 2213: premios y quiniela ganadora del fin de semana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-cbd-products.html>What Is It, Is It Legal, And Will It Get You High?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib.
