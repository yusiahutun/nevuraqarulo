Of course, at the heart of Rodrigo’s songs is romance, and she’s been keeping fans interested in her entanglements ever since she crashed onto the scene with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a39617556/olivia-rodrigo-performance-grammys-2022/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="her first single" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">her first single</a>, “Drivers License.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While “Drivers License” and the rest of Rodrigo’s 2021 debut album, Sour, grabbed headlines due to the backstory involving her ex-boyfriend Joshua Bassett, it was the music that rose above the noise. Since then, Rodrigo has had other partners and she’s released other music (like <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/art-books-music/a45051626/olivia-rodrigo-guts-pop-up-spotify-american-express/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="2023’s phenomenal Guts" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">2023’s phenomenal Guts</a>) that only continues to build on her strengths.

In those photos, one snap seemed to capture Partridge’s arm around the singer.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Then, the couple basically confirmed their romance in December, when they were caught kissing on the streets of New York City. That same month, the British-born actor came to support Rodrigo after her performance as musical guest on Saturday Night Live, and the two were seen leaving the sketch show’s afterparty together. Only days prior, Partridge had also gone to see the “Vampire” singer at the iHeartRadio Z100 Jingle Ball show, where he was spotted standing next to her friends Conan Gray and Madison Hu.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Zack Bia (February–August 2022)</h2><img alt="olivia rodrigo and zack bia walking" title="olivia rodrigo and zack bia walking" width=1364 height=2048 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/blu-a34819803-65aaddf9aa972.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Splash News</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Although it’s unclear how Bia and Rodrigo first met, their connection seems to date back to January 2022, when they attended a number of the same parties. (Rodrigo was still with former boyfriend Adam Faze at the time).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Their relationship began around February, when Bia—a producer, DJ, and record executive—invited Rodrigo to see one of his sets during Super Bowl weekend. Later that year, a source confirmed to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/music/olivia-rodrigo-dating-zack-bia-really-like-each-other-exclusive/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">People</a> that this was the beginning of their romance, saying, “They’ve been dating since the Super Bowl. They really like each other.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After Rodrigo hung with Bia at the NFL championship, the DJ attended the singer’s birthday party at SHOREbar in Santa Monica. Then in April, the pair were spotted out in public together for the first time, taking a walk in New York City. Finally, after months of speculation, it was confirmed they were an item in June.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">However, due to their busy schedules, the couple called it quits that August.

At the time, the outlet said she’d attended the July 2021 premiere of Space Jam: A New Legacy with Faze as her plus-one.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A mere two weeks later, paparazzi captured the two kissing on the streets of Los Angeles. However, the couple kept their relationship mainly under wraps for the half a year they spent together.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It was speculated by fans that they went their separate ways in January 2022, when Rodrigo unfollowed the director on Instagram.

On the series, they played each other’s love interests, and offscreen, they quickly bonded over their love of songwriting. In August of that same year, they performed together at a Disney+ Showcase, three months before their TV show premiered.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For the series, Bassett and Rodrigo wrote the song “Just for a Moment,” but that wasn’t the only way their actual romance blurred with what was happening on the musical show. In fact, in an interview with the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2020-01-10/high-school-musical-the-musical-the-series-disney-plus-nini-ricky-olivia-rodrigo-joshua-bassett data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="L.A. Times" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">L.A. Times</a>, Bassett discussed a moment when his character confesses his love for Rodrigo’s character, and said he improvised parts of the scene with details from their real-life relationship. “Every single time [we filmed it], I would change it to something else that was specific to her and I, and getting her reaction out of it was the best thing in the world,” he said. Rodrigo commented on the same moment, adding, “He said, ‘Remember that one time that we wrote a song, and we didn’t know if anybody would like it?’ That one made me cry because I just remembered sharing those memories with him…I love him so much. He’s my best friend…It was like I wasn’t acting.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But it was believed the pair had split when Bassett was spotted with Sabrina Carpenter in July 2020. The end of their relationship is highly speculated to be the subject of Rodrigo’s smash debut single, “Drivers License.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The best evidence we have of Rodrigo and Bassett’s relationship came in summer 2022, when the “Bad Idea Right?” singer accidentally followed her former costar on Instagram. (She famously follows no one on the social media app.) In December 2023, Rodrigo stopped by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8IZsYkFIM" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</a> and discussed the mishap, saying, “I had this very embarrassing encounter once where I was stalking my ex—as one does, sue me, sorry—and I accidentally followed him because I was stalking him.”</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/04e4fe03-f532-4e6a-8cd4-455131aa4449_1702400410.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Joel Calfee" title="Headshot of Joel Calfee" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Joel is the editorial and social media assistant for HarpersBAZAAR.com, where he covers all things celebrity news.
