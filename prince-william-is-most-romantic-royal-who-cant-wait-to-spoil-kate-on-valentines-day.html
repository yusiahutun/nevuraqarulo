He says <a href=#>Prince William</a> is likely to treat his wife even more this year because of her <a href=#>recent routine surgery in hospital</a>. The ex-staffer also remembers <a href=#>King Charles</a> had a soft side, saying he would take Camilla – and Princess Diana when she was alive – to dinner on February 14.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-prince-william-is-the-most-romantic-member-of-the-royals-especially-with-kate-middleton>Prince William is the ‘most romantic’ member of the royals – especially with Kate Middleton</h2><p>Valentine’s Day seems to explode into stores around the world towards the end of January, or even sooner in some cases. Although not all follow the tradition, it has cemented itself into mainstream culture for anyone who does want to show gratitude to their special someone each February.</p><p>Now, a former butler has said Prince William will enjoy the upcoming Valentine’s Day because he’s the ‘most romantic’ of the members of the <a href=#>royal</a> family. He says he’ll likely shower Kate with “flowers, chocolates and special gifts” next week.</p><p>He remembers <a href=#>Prince Harry</a>‘s brother being a “true gentleman” with the Princess of Wales, and recalled one particular meal he planned.</p><p>Grant <a href=# rel=nofollow>told</a> Slingo: “His attention to detail is always spot on and what he does to make Kate feel important and appreciated. He’s the most romantic royal.</p><p>“I remember doing one of my first dinners for the two of them, and it was around Valentine’s Day. He was involved in all the planning, he had thought everything out. He thought about how the table was going to look, every detail. He is a romantic, but he enjoys it too.</p><p>“He’s very sweet and cares about what she thinks. He is the happiest when he is with Kate. This is why I’ve always known Kate and William to be the most perfect match. They just fit. But William has been a gentleman since he was a young lad. They celebrate Valentine’s Day.</p><p>“There will be flowers involved, chocolates, and special gifts. They are romantics deep down, which I think surprises people.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-royals-are-showing-their-feelings-more>Royals are ‘showing their feelings more’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-118246861-1024x672.jpg><p>Grant says the royals are better at showing emotion in public now.</p><p>He added: “It’s interesting because the Royals never used to show emotion to one another, especially in public. But now they do, and they talk about each other affectionately. It’s refreshing to see.</p><p>“If they were at an event on Valentine’s Day itself, we might see them being more affectionate than normal because they express themselves a lot more than they used to.</p><p>“They didn’t dare express themselves 20 years ago. It wasn’t acceptable.”</p><p>The former butler then divulged the King, when he was prince, asked him to get a film for Charles and <a href=#>Camilla</a> to watch together. He chose the classic Marilyn Monroe flick Some Like It Hot.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2WCcLzRoqWcnV2stq24yJqkZqGjYrqwv9NmqailkaPBqq%2BMq6aymZxixKm7jJyYp6xdrK6qwIytpmaroKS2rXnKmqueZZ%2Bjerety56lraGemsBusMCyZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./stephane-lambiel.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Stephane Lambiel dating?
