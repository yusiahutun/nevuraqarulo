He was very young, but bent forward, his back almost perpendicular with his lower body – probably a habitual user of fentanyl, the drug that’s been destroying so many lives in San Francisco.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The online videos are real. In the city’s downtown, we saw scores of addicts roaming the streets at all hours of the day, some petrified, literally, by the effects of “tranq dope”, a combination of fentanyl and animal tranquilliser.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Like most people in San Francisco and other big cities, we instinctively ignored the young man, inwardly justifying our indifference with vague rationalisations of not wanting to be enablers of substance abuse or street begging.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But these excuses we told ourselves quickly gave way to the heartbreaking reality right in front of us: a cold, desperately hungry man was asking us for help. We went into a nearby gas station and bought him some sandwiches.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/10/28/e397193b-181c-49f7-ba73-3cb2e722cbaa_465a37f3.jpg>Synthetic drugs like <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">fentanyl</span></a> and <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">methamphetamine</span></a> are relatively recent inventions, but the Chinese were “cooking” a drug called wushisan (“five-rock powder”) almost 2,000 years ago.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Wushisan was very popular among the elites during the period known as the Wei, Jin, Northern and Southern dynasties (220–589).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Some historians have postulated that the prevalent use of psychotropic drugs at the time, in addition to widespread alcoholism and the popularity of a philosophy called Mystical Learning, was a coping mechanism for disenchanted intellectuals in that three-and-a-half centuries of intense political and social turmoil.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to an extant formula, wushisan was made by combining the pulverised forms of five different mineral substances (hence its name): stalactite, amethyst, quartz, sulphur crystal and red halloysite. There might have been other additives.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Users of wushisan reported a feeling of euphoria and heightened sensory perceptions, which were quite likely the effects that many were chasing, but one of its most obvious effects was a marked increase in one’s body temperature.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/10/28/acf9401c-705c-47cb-82d6-7b9a1e8a63b1_9152aa6e.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To dissipate the heat, the user had to take cold foods (hence its alternative name hanshisan – “cold-foods powder”) or icy baths. He could even recline naked on a rock in midwinter, according to a description of the drug’s effects.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Because of its ability to increase blood circulation, wushisan was also taken by men as an aphrodisiac. One unexpected consequence of taking the drug was the lightening of one’s complexion, a standard of beauty much sought after by both men and women of that era.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He Yan (196–249), a senior courtier in the Wei dynasty, whose handsome features and fair skin were feted across the realm, was an avid user of wushisan.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While it is not recorded whether wushisan was addictive, its ill effects were soon apparent. He Yan was later described by a contemporary as looking like ghost with an ashy, withered complexion. Mentally, he was unfocused and confused. Other users reported painful, swollen limbs, breathlessness and coughing fits.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Its popularity waned soon after, and by the Tang dynasty (618–907), no one was taking wushisan any more.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Painkiller on Netflix depicts US opioid crisis.

An investigative report by the San Francisco Chronicle reveals that highly organised Honduran cartels are responsible for the cheap, easily available fentanyl on the streets. The city’s politicians and law enforcement agencies continue to wrangle over eradication or harm reduction strategies.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After coming home from the US, I sometimes think of that young man, trapped in a spiral of his wretched circumstances, who came to us for help that night. I can only hope that you’re OK.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZL2wv9NmpJqfka%2B2r7GOrJ%2BoqqRiv6atw6xmmqqknrCtsY5saWxxZWeEcLLEp6uapqmheqKww6KaratdqK6vecWrmKebmaiwsHnAp5qinZ6peqS0yKecrJ1dna6ledOhnKKqXZm%2FtrOMnJ%2BooZOaenZ50aiapGWgpMSlsdE%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./paris.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Paris: Latest News, Pictures &amp;amp; Videos</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./charlize-theron-daughter-august-7-appearance-sparks-reaction-new-photos-nyc-trip.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Charlize Theron's daughter August, 7, leaves fans saying the same thing in rare photos from mother-d</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./french-montanas-solid-wallet-explains-why-he-aint-worried-bout-nothin.html>French Montanas solid wallet explains why he Aint Worried Bout Nothin Tue 5 July 2022</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-jackson-new-album-songs-for-mother-daughters.html>Alan Jackson's New Album Features Songs for His Late Mother, More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-f1cf0f18-55b5-552e-a3b7-517c726ba35c-html.html>Eagles C Jason Kelce retires after 13 seasons | National</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65b82c73268e3ecb698b458b-html.html>Resultados Progol 2213: premios y quiniela ganadora del fin de semana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-cbd-products.html>What Is It, Is It Legal, And Will It Get You High?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib.
