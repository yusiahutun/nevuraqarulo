The singer joked that the cap made her look like "that girl" in JT's music video for "Cry Me a River" -- which starred a Britney lookalike. Timberlake has stated his split from Spears inspired the video.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>In her post's caption, Britney wrote, "Thoughts while making this video 🤔 … Hmmmm something looks familiar …. The hat 👒 …. wait I look 👀 like that girl in the Justin Timberlake video with that hat in Cry Me A River !!! Oh s--- that's ME !!! I'm Britney Spears ⭐️ ??? I guess I forget that sometimes 🙊😂🤷🏼‍♀️ …"</p><p>"Oh s--- I look like a doctor in this video too though with the white coat 👩🏼‍⚕️ … maybe I'M THE DOCTOR … I mean who's playing who 😜 ???" she continued, referencing an oversized white blazer she modeled in the clip. "I mean my brother wears that kind of hat … but wait the skirt … I haven't worn a skirt in forever !!!"</p><p>She added, "Am I Britney Spears ??? Psssss HMMM 🤔 all this time ??? Play on my icons … play on 🤪!!!!"</p><p>Fans took to the comments section to share their thoughts on Britney's post -- and it's safe to say they were loving it, particularly the Grammy winner calling out her ex.</p><p>"OMFG THE SHADE 😂," a user wrote, while another commented, "We loveeeee the shade. Lol. 😂:"</p><p>"She's calling them out we love to see it," another added. "Omg, queen of shade 😂😂😂:," a fan wrote as another told the "Toxic" singer to "DRAG THEM ALL."</p><p>Britney and Justin dated for three years before they ultimately split in 2002. After their breakup, Justin released the music video for "Cry Me a River," a song about a cheating girlfriend.</p><p>For years, Justin denied that his 2002 hit was written about Britney. However, he later appeared to confirm it was about the "Circus" singer.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:f00f49a7-7daa-4da3-8a30-5eb996232e17 data-container-ref=toofab:article:dd7beb28-61c6-4065-bbeb-d41d5571c996 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/1e/5by4/2021/10/13/1e6aeae574b24a09a88caeeb0d8604c8_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Did Britney Spears Just Shade Sister Jamie Lynn After Memoir News?</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Huffington Post</a>, during a 2011 episode of "E! True Hollywood Story" about <a href=#>Timbaland</a>, who produced "Cry Me a River," Timbaland said, "He went to a concert and saw Britney, and Britney talked about him in the show and he was pissed."</p><p>"I was on a phone call that was not the most enjoyable phone call," Justin said. "I walked into the studio and he [Timbaland] could tell I was visibly angry."</p><p>Britney opened up about her reaction to the video that same year.</p><p>"He called me up and behind it was, 'And by the way, you're in a video that's coming out. Don't worry about it. It's not a big deal,'" she recalled to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolling Stone</a> in 2011. "So the record label called and said, 'If you want to change this, you can.' I had the power to say no to the video. But I didn't, because I thought, 'Hey, it’s your video.'"</p><p>"I hadn't seen it. Then it came out, and I said, 'I should've freakin' said no to this s---!' I was so like, 'Woah. What is going on right now?' ... I think it looks like such a desperate attempt, personally. But that was a great way to sell the record. He's smart.
