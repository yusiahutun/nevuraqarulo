Assess Your Skin Type</strong></p><p>One of the most important factors to consider before buying the best BB cream for sensitive skin is whether you have oily or dry skin type. If your skin is oily, you should go for non-comedogenic products that won’t lead to breakouts. However, if your skin is dry, you should consider using BB creams with nourishing formulations. You can look out for ingredients like jasmine, and plant-based oils like jojoba, sunflower, etc. to seal in the moisture.</p><p><strong>2. Check the Shade</strong></p><p>To complement your natural skin tone, it’s important to buy a BB cream that enhances your skin texture. You should go for a shade that neither feels too dark nor too light for your skin. Sharing a pro tip, our contributor Dr. Zeeshan Afzal, Health Content Advisor - Welzo, an online healthcare platform, says, “For sensitive skin, it's best to choose a BB cream shade that matches your natural skin tone. Opt for a hypoallergenic and fragrance-free product to minimize the risk of irritation.”</p><p>Do a swatch test and get a shade that offers medium coverage to get a flawless complexion.</p><p><h2 class=title>How Should You Apply BB Cream on Sensitive Skin?</h2></p><p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Cleanse your face thoroughly.</p><p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Apply a pea-sized amount of moisturizer. You can also use toner/serum if you include them in your skincare routine. If you have oily skin, you can skip using moisturizer if your BB cream has a nourishing formula.</p><p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Take a dollop of BB cream and apply it evenly on your face. You can use your fingers, brush, or sponge to blend it on your face.</p><p><strong>Step 4: </strong>You can follow it up with the foundation if you need more coverage.</p><p><strong>Step 5: </strong>Use sunscreen to complete the routine. If your BB cream has decent SPF protection, you can skip this step.</p><p>Sensitive skin may be prone to a lot of issues, but using proper skincare products can help you deal with them easily.
