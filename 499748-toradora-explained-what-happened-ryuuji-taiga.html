The romantic-comedy series, written by Takemiya Yuyuko and illustrated by Yasu, is about two <a href=#>high school</a> students, Ryuuji and Taiga. They are determined to date each other’s best friends. But as they spend time together, they have a change of heart which influences their end game. So, what does the Toradora! ending mean for the two?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/97033abd6a6b032c.jpg><p class=align-left>Some animations make the heart warm, and Toradora is one of them. It was first released as a light novel and became one of the most popular romantic animations. It aired from 2008 – 2009 and released 25 episodes, including some special episodes at the end. However, the anime's ending confused many viewers; most don't know what happened between the main characters.</p><h2>How did the Toradora manga end?</h2><p class=align-left>The Toradora <a href=#>manga</a> plot is from a light novel. But in the <a href=#>series</a>, the original story took to a turn and had a different ending to the one planned by the author. The anime ends on high school graduation day when the main characters have their final meeting. It's here that Taiga made her ultimate decision to leave Ryuji.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/56388c7dee5e2a71.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>List of male Naruto characters that you need to know about</span></p></a><p class=align-left>But in the light novel, Ryuji hard started his third year in school. He and Taiga met on their way to high school and later parted ways. This is the only change that happened in the anime. Other parts of the anime trace a similar path as in the light novel.</p><p class=align-left>However, some viewers think the Toradora manga depicted the separation story better than the animation. In the manga, the illustrator beautifully traced the extended panels, and the grief of separation was precisely expressed.</p><h2>Why did Taiga leave Ryuuji at the end?</h2><p class=align-left>Taiga leaving Ryuuji completes her character arc. Taiga was a mess at the start, and Ryuuji helped her learn how to interact with others. That's without being condescending, violent, and rude because of her broken upbringing and wrecked home life.</p><p class=align-left>By the end of the anime, Taiga has matured a lot. In the last two episodes, she watches how Ryuuji inadvertently damages his home life and fixes it in a matter of days. This makes Taiga decide that, at this point, she must also fix her issues.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/fad3fcd4a3043485.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Edwin Chiloba, Jeff Mwathi, Other Deaths That Hit Headlines Since Year 2023 Began</span></p></a><p class=align-left>She leaves Taiga to face things that caused all her problems which include fixing her relationship with her mother and step-siblings.</p><h2>Does Toradora have a sad ending?</h2><p class=align-left>The Toradora ending is a bit complicated. In the entire series, Taiga and Ryuuji have a lot of issues. Taiga is from a well-off <a href=#>family</a>; however, her parents divorce, and her father gets a new wife. Taiga is put aside by her dad, who cares more about his new wife. She realizes this quickly and asks to stay in her place, which neighbors Ryuuji's place.</p><p class=align-left>Taiga is adversely affected by her family situation – though she doesn’t accept this at the beginning of the series. It makes her impulsive, rude, and argumentative at the start of the <a href=#>animation</a>. Her character development arc is the main element of Toradora's anime. She realizes she needs to change to be a better lover for Ryuuji.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/aab22e4a59cb7d52.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kenyans Celebrate Woman Helping School Children Cross Flooded Paths in Kibra After Heavy Rains</span></p></a><p class=align-left>On the other hand, Ryuuji lives with his loving mother, Yasuko. His father left while he was still a baby. Ryuuji and his mother struggle to get by, but they always manage. He helps his mother a lot, more so with house chores. At the end of the anime, his family issues also escalate.</p><p class=align-left>But contrary to popular belief, the ending wasn't sad; it was satisfying and rounded the main<a id=https://www.tuko.co.ke/facts-lifehacks/tv-movies/495909-36-male-anime-characters-black-hair-ranked-basedpopularity/ href=#> anime characters'</a> arcs well.</p><h2>Did Ryuuji and Taiga get married?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/56388c7dee5e2a71.jpeg><p class=align-left>In the anime, unfortunately, Taiga and Ryuuji didn't marry. They gave up on marriage after realizing they couldn't do it without their family and friends.</p><h2>Minori’s Sad Ending</h2><p class=align-left>Right from the start of the anime, fans rooted for Minori. She chose to be Taiga's friend from the beginning to the end, even though they had opposite personalities. But their contrasting personalities complemented each other quite well.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/925fab2ca97f147b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Nairobi Author Starts Philanthropic Initiative to Donate Storybooks to Marginalised Schools</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Taiga was viewed through a sympathetic lens in the anime because she was from a damaged family. On the other side, Minori, who had to endure losing a loved one, didn't have a proper ending.</p><p class=align-left>Some fans feel it was unfair for one of the characters to experience this arc in a flawed story like the Toradora manga. Right from the start of the anime, viewers can see what will transpire for the characters and the fate that will befall them. But it wasn't fair for Minori to be the one to sacrifice the love of her life.</p><h2>Frequently asked questions</h2><li>What age rating is Toradora? Toradora's age rating is 13+, and kids below 13 are advised to watch the anime under parental guidance.</li><li>Did Toradora have a happy ending? Yes, Toradora has a good and satisfying ending that rounded off the central character arcs so well.</li><li>What does the name Toradora mean? Toradora's title means tiger and dragon. The combination of these two words makes Toradoragon and Toradora the easiest to remember.</li><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ee3eb5b012bec0b4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kenyan Couple Die Together in Tragic Road Accident in US, Leave Behind&nbsp;3&nbsp;Children</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Toradora! ending is among the most unclear endings in anime history. In the last few scenes, Toradora's manga narrative shifted into something no one expected. Truly Toradora is a flawed story, but it all depends on how fans look at the conclusion. Its ending created a vast divide; some fans loved how it ended. But others were keen to notice the massive flaw in their characters.</p><p class=align-left>Tuko.co.ke also has shared an article about the best-<a href=#>streaming anime apps</a>. The number of anime fans is increasing daily because of how interesting they are. There are many apps where you can watch anime, but finding the best app can be hectic.</p><p class=align-left>Many apps are illegal, filled with intrusive ads, or don't work as intended.
