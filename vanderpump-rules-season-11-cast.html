Racquel Leviss is not returning to Vanderpump Rules Season 11. Though, at the time of writing this,<a href=#> TMZ</a> reported that Raquel is still not locked in. At the Season 10 Reunion, she told Andy Cohen on a one-on-one confessional. Though some of the cast has qualms with it. “I can picture [us filming together] because I’ve had to picture it,” Scheana Shay said. “That’s the name of the game. But I can’t envision what type of event that would be at, and it would have to be something Lisa Vanderpump hosts,” she explained. “[Because] they’re not getting invited to any birthday parties, that’s for sure.”</p><p>Ariana herself had something to say about filming with her ex-lover and ex-friend. “I have nothing to say to either of them,” Madix told the <a href=# rel=nofollow>New York Times</a>. “Our show is very real and follows a real group of friends, and neither of them are in the group of friends, so, good luck.”</p><p>In April 2023, Raquel voluntarily checked herself into a mental health facility amid #Scandoval. “Raquel and her family decided before the relationship was discovered that she would enter a voluntary facility for mental health counseling,” read a statement from the reality star’s rep. “Raquel had planned to admit herself before the VPR reunion was taped on March 23. She was scheduled to go in pre-reunion but decided she wanted to finish her filming commitment. Bravo and production were aware and in support of her journey towards better mental health.”</p><p>She re-entered the facility after the reunion.“Upon the completion of filming the reunion, Raquel entered a voluntary inpatient behavioral health and trauma facility and remains there to date — 68 days and counting,” an insider told<a href=# rel=nofollow> Us Weekly.</a> “Her treatment is helping her learn the basis of her decisions and to grow from her mistakes with the hope of making better choices and becoming a better person.”&nbsp;</p><p>On June 30, 2023, <a href=# rel=nofollow>TMZ</a> reported that Raquel was “in negotiations” for her return to&nbsp;VPR, but that Bravo was awaiting her exit from the mental health facility to be sensitive to her struggles. “Whatever terms they have already discussed, it appears none were deal-breakers, because the negotiations are continuing,” the tabloid observed.”</p><p>They also reported a source that said Raquel was leaving the facility “soon”, which would give Bravo the “green light” to negotiate. “The reality, if Bravo jumps the gun, makes a deal and brings her back too early, they could face legal peril if she backslides,” the gossip site reported, concluding: “A source connected to the show tells us production is ready when she is ready.” According to a source quoted in <a href=# rel=nofollow>People</a>, “Raquel’s family doesn’t want her to film, but the cast is betting she appears at some point.”&nbsp;</p><p>According to the&nbsp;LA Times,&nbsp;she was meant to come back but after the fallout of Scandoval, things got tricky for Raquel.&nbsp;“We had conversations with both her reps and her directly. Our first concern was how she was doing, and whether or not it made sense…personally, emotionally. She was very conflicted about it,”&nbsp;Executive Producer Alex Baskin shared.&nbsp;“There was, frankly, a lot of conversations about money. Her team was very clear that they felt that she should be rewarded. At one point,&nbsp;they raised the idea of her getting a development deal.”</p><p>Based on what she told Bethenny Frankel on her&nbsp;Just B&nbsp;podcast; “I just heard what you were saying on TikTok and using my case as an example of exploitation and the way that the network is running to the bank—like laughing, running to the bank with this scandal and I haven’t seen a single penny,” Leviss said. “I feel like it’s not fair and I feel like a toddler saying, ‘It’s not fair,’ but it really isn’t.”</p><p>She continued, “And I feel like I’ve been portrayed as the ultimate villain. My mistakes, that I’ve made on camera, live on forever. And you mentioned the addiction of doing reality TV and the way they always dangle that carrot in front of you telling you, ‘You need to tell your side of the story, otherwise it’s going to be written for you.’ And that’s terrifying. So, I almost went back just because of that.”</p><p>Leviss, who now goes by Rachel, will be launching her podcast Rachel Goes Rogue in the same month.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xpqjpZ2irny3rc2dnKuopaK9br7UpZysZaOarrS7zWZoamWTlsC1ew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./single-parents-guide-travelling-children-tips-and-tours.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>A single parents guide to travelling with children: tips and tours that ease the burden</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./steve-lund-actor.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Steve Lund dating?
