Mr. Rodriguez is best known for being the owner of Don Coqui.</strong></h3><h2>Jimmy Rodriguez - Cheated On Wife Elaine Rodriguez</h2><p>Popular American restaurateur, <strong>Jimmy Rodriguez</strong> was once a married man to his then-girlfriend turned wife, <strong>Elaine Rodriguez.</strong> The former duo exchanged their wedding vows in a private closed ceremony in Porto Rico in 1985.</p><p>Jimmy and his wife shared three children. They are parents to two daughters <strong>Jaleene Rodriguez </strong>and <strong>Jewelle Rodriguez,</strong> and another mysterious child who was born in the mid-90s.</p><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2021/05/04/jimmy-dining-with-his-daughter-1620131882.jpg width=450 height=297 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><strong><span class=imageCaption>Jimmy Rodriguez dining with his daughter. </span><span class=imageSource>SOURCE: Pinterest</span></strong><p>However, things went wrong for the Rodriguez family, when Elanie filed a case against Jimmy accusing him of having extra affairs with his restaurant employee. Elaine sensed things were not going smooth with their marriage where she realized her husband was running away from the family responsibility.</p><p>Not to mention, Elaine also learned about her <a href=# rel=noopener>estranged husband's infidelity</a> from different women who constantly made phone calls to her. Also, according to their divorce documents, Elaine claimed Jimmy tried to hit her with his car.</p><p>Not long after the birth of their third child, Elanie and Jimmy officially split in 1997 and eventually signed a divorce paper with the restaurateur having to make a child support payment of <strong>$12,000</strong> every month.</p><p></p><p>However, things weren't easy for Jimmy to pay <strong>$12000</strong> a month for her ex-wife and children. Jimmy claimed his restaurant business was already at loss and that he was struggling to pay for child support.</p><p>Jimmy and his then-wife Elaine finally signed their divorce paper in 2004 amidst the circulation of the rumor that Jimmy was a father of a child of another woman.</p><h2>Jimmy Rodriguez Dated Actress Michael Michele</h2><p>After living separately from his ex-spouse, the nightlife king, Jimmy Rodriguez, fell in love with 'Gossip Girl' actress <strong>Michael Michele</strong>.

In 2017, Michele shared pictures of her son J. Brandon on Twitter which indicated she could be a single mother today.</p><p>Jimmy was also believed to be the father of J. Brandon who was born in 2005. And, it's also believed Rodriguez & Michele had the baby just before they ended their relationship.

The average salary earned by the manager of the restaurant in New York is <strong>$62,880</strong>.
