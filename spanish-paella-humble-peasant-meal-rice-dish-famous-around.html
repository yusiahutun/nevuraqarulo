However, the grain was introduced to Spain in the 8th century by Moorish invaders from northern Africa. The Moors first began cultivating rice in Spain in the Albufera wetlands, to the south of the city of Valencia.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2021/01/26/c143b8e8-5bca-11eb-a99a-beae699a1a1d_972x_173210.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Paella originated in the 19th century, although there are earlier versions of arroz à la Valenciana and arroz à la Morisca [rice cooked the Moorish way] that can be found in cookbooks dating back to the 16th century,” says Maria Paz Moreno, professor of Spanish language and culture at the University of Cincinnati in the US, and the author of many cookbooks featuring Spain’s gastronomic traditions.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Rice became a widespread crop in Spain in the 18th century, when increasingly sophisticated cultivation and irrigation techniques allowed farmers to both drain the marshlands distant from urban areas and prevent malaria outbreaks in the flooded fields required to grow the crop, Moreno says; the then new drug quinine could be used to treat malaria.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Curry puffs: how Portuguese empadas took Southeast Asia by storm</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A paella culture flourished in the Valencia region because it is an ideal place to grow rice thanks to its specific humidity, weather and fertile soil. Popular indigenous rice varieties such as bomba, senia and bahia are characterised by their low starch release and the capacity to absorb the flavours of the ingredients with which they are cooked, making them ideal for paella. Today, the best rice grown in Spain is cultivated in Valencia’s Albufera national park, which consists of a lagoon surrounded by old farms called barracas.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Juan Valero Munoz’s family has been growing rice since the late 1800s on the 250-hectare Tartana plantation in Albufera. In the old days, paella was a communal, humble peasant dish, the product of a joint effort by local communities that originally included fish.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Rice field workers, hunters and fishermen were poor people who came together, and each one brought one thing: chicken, duck, eels, green beans, white beans, lard, rice, salt,” says Munoz. “Each used to cultivate and produce one different ingredient at home.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2021/01/26/c3a2e672-5bca-11eb-a99a-beae699a1a1d_972x_173210.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Arroz à la Valencia is cooked in a regular pan, while the one used for paella is much larger, flat and round. The name paella possibly comes from the Latin patella, meaning “pan”, but another more romantic legend has it that the word is short for por ella, “for her” – a dish supposedly made by husbands on Sundays to honour the hard work done at home by their wives.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Paella was originally cooked on an open fire and eaten directly from the pan by field workers. It was made simply with rice, saffron, and the seasonal vegetables and meat available. Over time, it has evolved from a simple daily dish into a festive one enjoyed on weekends and holidays.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In many rural mountain areas it is still typical to cook it with rabbit and snails, while on the coast it is cooked with seafood, fish broth instead of meat broth, and even squid ink,” says Moreno. “There are many versions of paella, but what is traditional is that it is considered a festive dish to be shared with family and friends, and thus it is typically cooked on Sundays as a special meal that requires a bit of preparation and which is often enjoyed outdoors.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2021/01/26/c43cd21e-5bca-11eb-a99a-beae699a1a1d_972x_173210.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Even though it is still considered a communal dish, paella is no longer eaten directly from the same huge pan, but served individually onto each diner’s plate.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Diehard culinary traditionalists in Valencia are proud of their “first” paella recipe and spell it with a capital P. Even though different variants and styles have taken hold, locals are serious about their traditional Paella Valenciana.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Only certain ingredients are acceptable, says chef Nacho Romero from Kaymus restaurant in Valencia. Chicken, rabbit, snails, ferraura or roget (a local variety of green flat beans), tavella and garrofon (local varieties of beans without the pod), tomato, extra virgin olive oil, saffron and rice, and seasonal artichokes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2021/01/26/c8b9a1b4-5bca-11eb-a99a-beae699a1a1d_972x_173210.JPG><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2021/01/26/c52a1eac-5bca-11eb-a99a-beae699a1a1d_972x_173210.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Locals get upset when they see other ingredients in a so-called Paella Valenciana,” says Romero. “It would be the same as for a Neapolitan to call a pizza with chorizo and pineapple pizza Margherita. Valencians do not like it when too many ingredients are mixed; that’s not the true paella because it goes against the idea of the humble dish created by poor families working in the countryside, who could not, of course, afford expensive seafood such as lobster.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Purists who wrinkle their noses at the thought of mixing meat with seafood in a rice dish feel globalisation and tourism have tainted the soul of their original speciality, even if it is one of the most replicated across the world and most googled online.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To raise awareness of the traditional dish, three years ago the city’s tourism promotion agency Visit Valencia launched World Paella Day, which is celebrated on September 20. New cooking schools in Valencia offer paella masterclasses to locals and visitors, while so-called paella ambassadors tour the world.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2021/01/26/c2909914-5bca-11eb-a99a-beae699a1a1d_972x_173210.JPEG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Javier Vicente Rejas, chef at Singapore’s FOC Spanish restaurant and a Valencia native, co-founded the London Paella School and plans to open a Singapore branch soon. Different varieties of paella are served at FOC, including less traditional dishes, with squid ink, prawns and squid, lobster, pork and mushrooms, and a vegetarian version.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Rejas says Asians have a love affair with paella, and it’s not just because rice is the main ingredient. The global popularity of the dish entices those who are eager to taste and learn to prepare it, and they are often amazed by the experience.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“When Chinese people come to Valencia, what they expect from a typical Valencian paella is a seafood paella, in fact, the translation of paella in Chinese is ‘rice with seafood’,” says Miguel Angel Perez, brand and markets manager for Visit Valencia, who has promoted paella in many Asian countries.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2021/01/26/c6e532cc-5bca-11eb-a99a-beae699a1a1d_972x_173210.JPEG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“They get really surprised when no shrimps or mussels are found,” he says. “But 200 years ago people did not have refrigerators, so seafood wasn’t really eaten. Locals would mainly have chicken, rabbit and vegetables … Ducks, which are also loved in Chinese cuisine, were and still are added to paella, as there are many ducks at Albufera lake.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the last 50 years, global mass tourism and culinary evolution have led to many different paella recipes, says Perez, and seafood is one of the most popular variations, even more desired than traditional Valencian paella.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Other varieties of the dish include arros negre (black rice made with squid ink), arros del senyoret (so-called gentleman’s rice with peeled and prepared seafood) and dishes made with cuttlefish, artichokes, green garlic, lobster, and striped and king prawns.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2021/01/26/c4827292-5bca-11eb-a99a-beae699a1a1d_972x_173210.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Paella-style dishes can be found across Europe because the Moors cultivated rice along the Mediterranean shores, making it a core binding element in the local food culture.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Portugal has almost exactly the same Spanish recipe, originally known as rice in the fashion of Valencia and today simply called seafood rice. Italy has risotto alla pescatora, rice cooked the fisherman’s way with seafood, and the yellow risotto alla Milanese with saffron and bone marrow.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOwu8Nmm6uhnqB8or7TopqlnV9ofnKEl3BraKuglruqv8dmp5qdnKGubrTUppmlnV2lsqK%2FwKerZqWVlrluvsicnGacmai1brLApqauq12Wv7DBzZ0%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./influencer-boxing-is-the-new-gold-standart-for-drama-content.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Fight Over Your Attention: Influencer Boxing</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./american-pie-star-seann-william-scott-files-divorce-four-years-marriage-olivia-korenberg-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>American Pie star Seann William Scott files for divorce after four years of marriage fromOlivia Ko</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./french-montanas-solid-wallet-explains-why-he-aint-worried-bout-nothin.html>French Montanas solid wallet explains why he Aint Worried Bout Nothin Tue 5 July 2022</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-jackson-new-album-songs-for-mother-daughters.html>Alan Jackson's New Album Features Songs for His Late Mother, More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-f1cf0f18-55b5-552e-a3b7-517c726ba35c-html.html>Eagles C Jason Kelce retires after 13 seasons | National</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65b82c73268e3ecb698b458b-html.html>Resultados Progol 2213: premios y quiniela ganadora del fin de semana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-cbd-products.html>What Is It, Is It Legal, And Will It Get You High?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib.
