James addressed the allegations on <a href=#>Twitter</a> at the time and he now hopes to relaunch himself in the social media field with a new makeup line.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/07/GettyImages-1447354070-1024x683.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-james-charles-begs-to-be-uncanceled-after-grooming-allegations>James Charles begs to be uncanceled after grooming allegations</h2><p>The social media star, who gained popularity as a beauty <a href=#>influencer</a> in 2016, broke his silence about allegations involving inappropriate online behavior with underage fans.</p><p>In a new interview with Cosmopolitan, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">James starts out by saying</a> “I don’t want to sit here and f**king mope and whine and cry, because nobody wants to hear it,” Charles continues, “I had to do a lot of thinking. Like, Okay, babe, this is your fault. No, you’re not a pedophile. No, you’re not a f**king groomer. No, you’re not a predator. But you made a big mistake.”</p><p><br>Charles also stated that he didn’t know the age of the fans he was speaking to and admitted that he was “mortified” when he found out.</p><p>“I’ve never been more disgusted in my life than when I found out that that kid was 16 years old,” he told Cosmo. “I was mortified, absolutely mortified.”</p><p>“I can’t even begin to explain to you how bad that week of my life was,” the 24-year-old added. “I was crying myself to sleep every single night. I was sitting there in bed staring at my phone. I wanted to kill myself. I wasn’t talking to anybody.”</p><p>In a Twitter statement on February 26, 2021, the YouTuber called the allegations “completely false” and stated that he “unfriended” the fan after finding out that he was 16 years old.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>YouTuber doesn’t speak to his brother</h2><p>The allegations and social media backlash not only took a toll on the <a href=#>YouTuber</a>‘s mental health but also on his relationship with close family members, he added in the interview.</p><p>James revealed that he no longer speaks to his younger brother, Ian Jeffrey, who works as a model in New York City.</p><p>He explained: “I see a lot of people saying, ‘Oh my god, nothing even happened to him, he got away from this scot-free with no sort of repercussions’. That is so far from the truth. It certainly wasn’t an overnight thing where now I’m slaying again.”</p><p>Elsewhere in the interview, James stated that the allegations shouldn’t have been labeled as “grooming” because “that word is a very popular buzzword right now, especially in politics and stuff. But the actual meaning of it has been so misconstrued.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>James will launch his makeup line Painted</h2><p>James is set to launch his own makeup brand called Painted after “four years of hard work”. He teased the makeup line in April in a short trailer shared on Twitter and <a href=#>Instagram</a> when he shared that the line will be released in the summer of 2023.</p><p>While details about the new products are yet to be confirmed, James announced in a new Instagram post that the line will officially launch in August.</p><p><strong>If you are affected by any issues raised in the article or would like someone to speak to, please call the Samaritans for free on 116 123.
