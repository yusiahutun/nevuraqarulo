Sarah Paulson holds the title for appearing on the series, having appeared in almost every season except for NYC and 1984.&nbsp;In an interview with Andy Cohen on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen </a>in 2021 she revealed her intent on going back to the horror primetime show. “It’s the first time in about three years where I don’t know. I think this is my last season of&nbsp;Horror Story, probably. I mean, I don’t know,” she said. “Every time he comes to me with some whack-a-doodle-stoodle character I tend to be like, ‘Yes! Let’s do it!’ But I don’t know.”</p><p>American Horror Story also has a slew of of celebrities going onto the show like Lady Gaga’s iconic run as the Countess in Hotel. She talked about how she was nervous on her first day on set. “I threw up in the plastic bag and I saved it and brought it to Ryan Murphy,” Gaga told reporters at a press junket on the set of the FX horror anthology via <a href=# rel=noopener>Variety.</a> “He was like, ‘Oh, you think you can disgust me? You can’t.’”She also told reporters that it was a good platform for her to be taken seriously as an actress for her first ever role. “It’s always been so important to me that if I were to ever to make a move in television or as an actress that it would never feel like a move and nobody would ever go, ‘Oh, here she is trying to become an actress and put out a clothing line and a record label’ – you know, that’s sort of the thing that everyone expects, right? That it’s time for my empire,” she went on. “I don’t give a f—k about that. It is completely unfulfilling to me. It does nothing for my soul. What I did want was to be taken seriously as an actress.”</p><p>Season 12 named Delicate is slated to be based on the source material of Danielle Valentine’s upcoming novel&nbsp;Delicate Condition. The novel, released in August 2023, is described as a gripping thriller about a woman who becomes convinced that a sinister figure is going to great lengths to make sure her pregnancy never happens.</p><p>So who is confirmed to be in the American Horror Story Season 12 cast?

It’s wild to get to bring her back. When I as originally on Coven, I was only supposed to be in a couple of episodes. It wasn’t supposed to be the whole season, or anything like that. They just were like, “Will you come and do three episodes?” And then, it just kept going and going and going. So, to be back now, five years later and playing Madison again, it’s just funny, and it goes to show that you never know what’s gonna happen on&nbsp;American Horror Story. You never know who’s gonna respond to a character.”</p><h2>Matt Czuchry</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Matt-Czuchry.jpg><p>Matt Czuchry was the first person to be announced to be part of the American Horror Story cast.
