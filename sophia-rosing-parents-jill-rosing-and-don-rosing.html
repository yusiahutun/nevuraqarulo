One of its students, Sophia Rosing was recorded using racial slurs against Kylah Spring, a Black student who was working an overnight shift at the Lexington campus. Sophia is seen barely able to stand as she tries to hit Kylah after being denied entry to Boyd Hall for failing to show her ID. Following this drunken episode, Sophia has been not only fired from her internship and possibly from the university too but she was also arrested on public intoxication, assault, and disorderly conduct charges. The next day in court, Sophia pleaded not guilty to all charges, and in the exclusive pictures obtained by DailyMail.com, from that day, her parents were seen leaving the courtroom.</p><p>So, to those wondering who her parents are, let us tell you all about them in the rest of the writing.</p><h3><strong>Who Are Sophia Rosing’s Parents?</strong></h3><p>Sophia Rosing’s parents are Jill and Don Rosing.
