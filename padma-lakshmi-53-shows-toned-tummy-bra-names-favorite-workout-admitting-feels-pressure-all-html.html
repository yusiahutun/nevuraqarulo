In many ways, they're dealing with so many issues that you or I didn't really have…social media being one, cell phones being another, and just the gazillion other forms of media out there. We had some of it, but it's exponentially grown in pressure and complexity.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I try my hardest to tell her that she's not done becoming who she's going to be. Many girls her age—regardless of the cultural differences, I did this as well when I was her age—put an extraordinary amount of pressure on themselves. We think we have to be perfect and great and fully formed at everything right away, because that's what we see in the media.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Even with this magazine cover, it's beautiful, but I had two hours of hair and makeup. I had a stylist who gathered the best clothes, and then we edited those outfits down and chose a very select few, which looked the best. We had lighting, we had a wind machine, we had a very talented photographer, and then we had four or five sets of eyes looking at the monitor to make sure we selected the best shots.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Yes. It can be daunting when you're a young girl or woman, and you look at all those polished images in our media, and you think, why don't I look like that? Well, because nobody looks like that! I mean, I think I look pretty good when I get up in the morning—as long as I have a good night's sleep—but there's a lot that goes into the end result.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Sometimes, we only get served the end result, and that's not reality. That's why I think, as women like me age—especially women who are in the media—it's very important not only for our peers, but also for everyone else who see us on TV or in magazines, to understand the truth behind the image.'</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKymqLWww8GisWiZoqm2pLjEZmhrbWRnf3h9jomYnaWRYpmit9KhpKJlZWh6tLTOsKpmrJ%2BjsqV5066kprFdl7%2Biec2apJ6rXZuut7vRoqueZaekv6y71K1kmpydnsG1tc2gZJ%2BdlaHAbrzRnqqsraKaeqK4y2efraWc</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rihanna-looks-unrecognizable-punky-blonde-hair.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Rihanna looks unrecognizable as she drips in pearls and debuts punky blonde hair</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./my-life-dong-dong-pig.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>My life with Dong Dong the pig: Justine Kwok, fashion designer-turned-eco warrior, talks physi</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./french-montanas-solid-wallet-explains-why-he-aint-worried-bout-nothin.html>French Montanas solid wallet explains why he Aint Worried Bout Nothin Tue 5 July 2022</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-jackson-new-album-songs-for-mother-daughters.html>Alan Jackson's New Album Features Songs for His Late Mother, More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-f1cf0f18-55b5-552e-a3b7-517c726ba35c-html.html>Eagles C Jason Kelce retires after 13 seasons | National</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65b82c73268e3ecb698b458b-html.html>Resultados Progol 2213: premios y quiniela ganadora del fin de semana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-cbd-products.html>What Is It, Is It Legal, And Will It Get You High?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib.
