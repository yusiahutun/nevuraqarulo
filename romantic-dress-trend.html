In 2020, we don’t need to reject our femininity to be strong or powerful and, as is always the way, what we wear reflects our evolved attitudes. Far from power suits and bold shoulders, or figure-hugging 'bombshell' dresses - looks that have typically characterised power dressing - romantic dresses are on the rise, imbuing a softer strength that offers a different kind of armour.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The leader of the pack is Pierpaolo Piccioli whose graceful, voluminous gowns <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/fashion-news/a26019474/celine-dion-cried-at-the-valentino-show/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="have moved numerous editors (and Celine Dion) to tears" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">have moved numerous editors (and Celine Dion) to tears</a>. Structural silhouettes come in the most romantic of fabrics and exuberant, joyful shades, favoured by Frances McDormand, Lady Gaga and Lizzo. “Today, romanticism is not a weakness, it’s a strength,” said the acclaimed designer in 2018. “You can be assertive and not be aggressive. Every hero or heroine in romanticism has had to pay sacrifice. If you’re rational you’re fine, but if you’re a romanticist you have to pay sacrifice. I think it’s time to say you can be a romanticist and everything can still be fucking good.”</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"Romanticism is not a weakness, it’s a strength"<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Of course, there’s Alexander McQueen, where Sarah Burton has made soft power the USP of the brand. Tailoring, she says, whether it be a dress or a jacket, is “about strength, but it’s also about being held”. No longer do the same power dressing codes apply. While the popularity of tailoring on and off the catwalk is not to be dismissed, the rise of romantic styles is reflective of the new ways in which women are choosing to dress - in a way that makes them feel strong and confident. Emilia Wickstead’s sophisticated, feminine dresses come with an architectural twist, while Cecilie Bahnsen’s pretty pastel looks are juxtaposed with sculptural shapes. Few could challenge the power of Comme des Garçon’s dramatic, avant-garde take on romance, nor the dark, exquisite romance at industry favourite Simone Rocha. Molly Goddard’s frothy tulle frocks feel subversive rather than wet. In fact, one of the label’s most famous poster girls is Killing Eve’s Villanelle, a serial killer who, aptly, given her choice of clothing, subverts typical notions of femininity.</p><img alt="Jodie Comer in Killing Eve" title="Jodie Comer in Killing Eve" width=4096 height=2731 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/16088804-high-res-killing-eve-1539084383.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">BBC</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“The conversations we're having as a society about power and gender, identity and politics, closely relate to clothing and fashion design because creating, feeling and projecting power is associated with what we have to say, what we stand for, and how we appear,” says Dr Rosie Findlay, course leader in MA Fashion Cultures at the London College of Fashion. “What kinds of clothing makes any given individual feel powerful is subjective, dependent on how they feel about themselves, how they conceive of power and how that translates into textures, silhouette and the feel of clothes on one's body.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The demand for romantic dresses is increasing. In January, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/fashion-news/a30497653/cecilie-bahnsen-designer-interview/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Dover Street Market opened a dedicated space for Cecilie Bahnsen’s voluminous, pretty designs" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Dover Street Market opened a dedicated space for Cecilie Bahnsen’s voluminous, pretty designs</a> and last year, the balloon-sleeved, smocked styles at new brand Sleeper became an instant summer hit. Harrods fashion director Lydia King says the store has noticed an increase in sales of romantic looks.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“At Harrods, we have seen romantic styles evolve as the demand continues to increase throughout the industry,” she told us. “Traditional fashion maisons such as Valentino, Miu Miu and Chloe, where romance is part of their DNA, take much more of a classic approach to romance through their exquisite embellishments and use of ruffles and lace. We’re also now starting to see the style filter into more contemporary designers such as Rotate who are adding their own modern twist to the trend.”</p><img alt="Cecilie Bahnsen" title="Cecilie Bahnsen" width=2632 height=1754 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/cecilie-bahnsen-1578929306.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy</span><p>Cecilie Bahnsen spring/summer 2020</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For Cecilie Bahnsen, the rise of the romantic dress as an empowered statement is no surprise. "We’ve had a long time with athleisure, sportswear and masculine styles, so maybe a lot of designers are reacting against that," she says. "I feel feminine and beautiful in a dress... It’s about finding femininity and beauty in a new way."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The more contemporary versions of the romantic dress can be viewed as adult versions of children’s party dresses, which could be problematic when viewed through the prism of dressing grown women like children. But, as Dr Findlay points out, the volume of these looks provides a crucial point of difference. “These dresses take up space, they take light colours, tulle, ribbons, and place them on adult bodies, perhaps reframing the 'frivolity' of these textures and colours,” she says. “So, they could be read as claiming something - a vision of femininity, taking up space in the world - that could make someone feel powerful.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This idea of volume and taking up space also plays a key role in Emilia Wickstead’s styles, which have been worn by the Duchess of Sussex, Lauren Dern and Lupita Nyong’o. “I use volume for different reasons,” she says. “Often it is about strength.” She references the custom-made dress she created for Olivia Colman to wear at this year’s Golden Globes. “It had a streamlined hem with a sleek train, contrasted with bigger sleeves that gave the dress a powerful silhouette,” she says. “But, it’s also about a sense of playfulness and glamour. I’m nostalgic by nature and love the theatre of wearing something whimsical. It’s about confidence and the joy that comes from dressing up.”</p><img alt=US-ENTERTAINMENT-FILM-TELEVISION-GOLDEN-GLOBES-ARRIVALS title=US-ENTERTAINMENT-FILM-TELEVISION-GOLDEN-GLOBES-ARRIVALS width=3418 height=4105 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/british-actress-olivia-colman-arrives-for-the-77th-annual-news-photo-1581089476.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">VALERIE MACON</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Olivia Colman wearing Emilia Wickstead at the Golden Globes 2020</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Bahnsen says the voluminous nature of the fabrics that she uses have a physical impact on the wearer. “When I wear one of these dresses, I walk differently,” she explains. “You become more aware of yourself when you have a big bouncy skirt on.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Although fashion’s approach to modern romance is varied, there is one commonality: comfort. These dresses billow and waft – while the silhouettes differ, they’re roomy and allow for maximum movement. These aren’t looks that sculpt or compress the body; they’re designed to be lived in on an everyday basis. They’re often teamed with boots, chunky sandals or trainers, which not only add modernity, but also ease. “There’s nothing more powerful than feeling carefree, and I’m a big believer that you can be well-dressed and comfortable at the same time,” says Wickstead, who tries on everything she designs to ensure it’s comfortable.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>There’s nothing more powerful than feeling carefree<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s a sentiment echoed <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/fashion-news/a19764475/sleeper-pyjamas-brand/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="by rising brand Sleeper" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">by rising brand Sleeper</a>, which was founded by former fashion editors Kate Zubarieva and Asya Varetsa initially as a pyjama brand. The romantic fabrics used, airy linens and lightweight silk-satins, were so luxe that shoppers started wearing them as ready-to-wear.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“When we were creating Sleeper, we were aspiring it to be the uniform for life’s happiest moments,” said Zubarieva. “We wanted women to feel confident - and real confidence comes with comfort. Our dresses are not only party-appropriate but also really comfortable for breastfeeding, taking long walks, exploring the world and being the best version of yourself.”</p><img alt=Sleeper title=Sleeper width=4480 height=6720 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/atlanta-linen-dress-in-azure-blue-marquise-linen-dress-in-azure-blue-michelin-linen-dress-in-azure-blue-1581090614.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy</span><p>Sleeper spring/summer 2020</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Whenever you feel comfortable and good in something, you also feel strong,” adds Bahnsen. “It’s not just about the big shoulder or a tight waist, it’s about having that comfort where your own personality can shine through. That’s strength.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Bahnsen raises a good point. Ultimately, what someone wears to make them feel powerful varies. It’s a personal choice and in a society where we’re being encouraged to display our individuality, empowered style is naturally a messy state of affairs. It’s too simplistic to say it is all power shoulders and androgyny, and reductive to say it’s about cinched-in waists and bombshell silhouettes. Power dressing today is about displaying individuality, be it Billy Porter in a white tux with a train dripping in feathers, or Frances McDormand in a turquoise ruffled Valentino cape and headdress.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Frances McDormand at the Met Gala 2018" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/screen-shot-2020-02-07-at-15-45-10-1581090328.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“When a style is so feminine, it becomes powerful,” says Shrimp’s founder Hannah Weiland, who feels at her most powerful in an ethereal dress. “You are owning being a woman, being a girl. To me, it’s the most powerful way to dress. Everyone has their own version of power-dressing… it’s a personal outfit that allows you to be and feel your best self.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">What the wave of romantic dresses offer is an alternative to dictated codes, another way of dressing for power, and it’s up to consumers, employers and designers to respond accordingly – to understand that romantic femininity is not a weakness.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“We think that power dressing is no longer about ‘dressing’ itself,” concludes Sleeper’s Varetsa. “Real power lies in knowing and accepting your true self. Female strength lies in self-love and the freedom of self-expression. The best part is, we now have lots of instruments to showcase this strength, no matter whether with puffed sleeves or with shoulder pads.”</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 e1jtuqk11"></span><h5 class="css-13733z5 e1jtuqk13">13 romantic dresses to wear for date nights and beyond</h5><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 e1jtuqk10"></span><img alt="Romantic dresses" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/cecilie-bahnsen-matches-1579263575.jpg title="Romantic dresses " width=1236 height=1854 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Like this article? <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://hearst.emsecure.net/optiext/optiextension.dll?ID=NcWDlPSSi3ArMtOF9jaHRFlg028yqv%2BS7JDU1yR%2BJcJf8Mnc86RUtj3qXHgtGJM%2BzsVdmM%2BoAI60NE" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sign up to our new newsletter" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Sign up to our new newsletter</a> to get more articles like this delivered straight to your inbox.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://hearst.emsecure.net/optiext/optiextension.dll?ID=NcWDlPSSi3ArMtOF9jaHRFlg028yqv%2BS7JDU1yR%2BJcJf8Mnc86RUtj3qXHgtGJM%2BzsVdmM%2BoAI60NE" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="SIGN UP" rel=nofollow data-href="https://hearst.emsecure.net/optiext/optiextension.dll?ID=NcWDlPSSi3ArMtOF9jaHRFlg028yqv%2BS7JDU1yR%2BJcJf8Mnc86RUtj3qXHgtGJM%2BzsVdmM%2BoAI60NE" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink class="body-btn-link css-lihu0l emevuu60">SIGN UP</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwssCsn6KnnmTAqbvWrGStqpWjsbR7wGxncWhpaIN4e9GopJqmpJ6wbrDRnqqsZaSnsq%2Bwjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./chloe-lattanzi-on-mom-olivia-newton-johns-cancer-death.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Chloe Lattanzi on Mom Olivia Newton-Johns Cancer Death</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./149251.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Samantha Sklar Promoted To Vice President Of A&amp;amp;R At Position Music</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./french-montanas-solid-wallet-explains-why-he-aint-worried-bout-nothin.html>French Montanas solid wallet explains why he Aint Worried Bout Nothin Tue 5 July 2022</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-jackson-new-album-songs-for-mother-daughters.html>Alan Jackson's New Album Features Songs for His Late Mother, More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-f1cf0f18-55b5-552e-a3b7-517c726ba35c-html.html>Eagles C Jason Kelce retires after 13 seasons | National</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65b82c73268e3ecb698b458b-html.html>Resultados Progol 2213: premios y quiniela ganadora del fin de semana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-cbd-products.html>What Is It, Is It Legal, And Will It Get You High?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib.
