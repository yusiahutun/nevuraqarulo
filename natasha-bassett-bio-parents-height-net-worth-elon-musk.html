HollywoodLife revealed her identity with a source claiming that the pair are in an exclusive relationship.</p><p>According to the source, “They have been dating for several months and are in a monogamous relationship right now.” PageSix reported that Elon and Natasha were seeing for “some time” and that they were “friends first and only became romantic after he split with Grimes.”</p><p>Daily Mail reported that “Elon looked happy and relaxed wearing a black jacket and jeans and completed the look with navy trainers as he stepped out.” Meanwhile, Natasha wore “a long dark coat and white boots and shielded her eyes with a pair of dark sunglasses.”</p><h3><strong>Natasha Bassett Dating History</strong></h3><p>Before Elon, Natasha Bassett was reportedly in at least one relationship. Back in 2017, she cozied up with singer-songwriter Josh Olsen in an IG post.

They were in a relationship with each other for three years and they were committed to co-parenting their son together. Elon revealed to Page Six, “We are semi-separated but still love each other, see each other frequently, and are on great terms”.</p><p>“It’s mostly that my work at SpaceX and Tesla requires me to be primarily in Texas or traveling overseas and her work is primarily in LA. She’s staying with me now and Baby X is in the adjacent room.”</p><p>Elon was also married to author Justine Musk from 2000 until 2008. He then began a long-term relationship with actress <a href=#>Talulah Riley</a>, and they were married first from 2010 until 2012 and again from 2013 until their final split in 2016.
