Scott, a graduate of the Royal College of Art in London, began his career in television as a designer and director before going into advertising as a commercial director.&nbsp;</p><p>He made his directorial debut with The Duellists in 1977 and rose to prominence with his following feature, Alien, in 1979. The Alien film was shown in 70 mm at midnight on May 25, 1979, as the opening night of the fourth Seattle International Film Festival.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>It received negative reviews upon its first release but went on to become a box-office triumph, earning the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, three Saturn Awards —&nbsp; Best Science Fiction Film, Best Direction for Scott, and Best Supporting Actress for Cartwright —&nbsp; and a Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation.</p><p>Alien’s popularity produced a media empire of films, novels, video games, and toys. The story of&nbsp;Sigourney Weaver’s character’s interactions with the alien species served as the conceptual and narrative foundation for the sequels: Aliens (1986), Alien 3 (1992), and Alien Resurrection (1997).&nbsp;</p><p>The Alien vs. Predator films were created through a collaboration with the Predator brand, and Scott helmed a two-film prequel series. While the Alien film franchise is not on <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/tag/netflix/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix</a>, there are various other movies by Scott on the streaming platform.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Here are the top five Ridley Scott movies on Netflix. <strong>Note:</strong> <strong>The availability of these movies on Netflix is based on where you live.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Blade Runner: The Final Cut (1982)</h2><p>The 1982 science fiction film <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Blade Runner</a> was directed by Scott and written by Hampton Fancher and David Peoples.

When a crew of sophisticated replicants commanded by Roy Batty (Hauer) flees to Earth, burnt-out detective Rick Deckard (Ford) grudgingly agrees to track them down.</p><p>As a consequence of controversial alterations sought by studio management, seven separate versions of Blade Runner exist. Following a positive reaction to test screenings of a workprint, a director’s cut was released in 1992.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>This, combined with the film’s success as a video rental, made it one of the first films to be released on DVD.

Paul Getty’s Heirs, it depicts the events surrounding the kidnapping of John Paul Getty III in 1973 and his grandfather’s refusal to cooperate with the kidnappers’ extortion demands.&nbsp;</p><p>The title of the movie comes from an early conversation between Gail Harris (Getty III’s mother) and Dante ‘Cinquanta’ Agnana (one of Getty III’s abductors). When Harris states she can’t pay the ransom because she doesn’t have any money, Aganana responds angrily, “Get it from your father-in-law.
