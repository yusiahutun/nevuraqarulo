He’s open-minded, spontaneous, and full of love. Thus, he was looking for someone who shared his love for adventure and excitement for the little things — which he believed were the qualities of the </span><i><span>Bachelorette</span></i><span> star Charity Lawson.</span></p><p><span>Let’s learn more about Dotun as this article proceeds.</span></p><h3><b>Dotun Olubeko On The Bachelorette</b></h3><p><span>Dotun Olubeko was one of the 25 men vying for Charity Lawson’s heart on </span><i><span>The Bachelorette</span></i><span> season 20. According to Reality Steve, he even made it to Charity’s final four alongside <a href=#>Xavier Bonner</a>, <a href=#>Joey Graziadei</a>, and <a href=#>Aaron Bryant</a>.</span></p><p><span>“I definitely am looking for someone who is a compassionate person, so someone who is extremely kind and treats others well. I think, for me, that’s something that I value and I have in myself, so I also want that in my partner,” Charity explained what she was looking for in a husband. “But also, I love to laugh and have a good time, so a sense of humor, I think that’s huge. So, anyone who can come up with a good joke or two is a winner.”</span></p><p><span>Reportedly, Charity’s overnights took place in Fiji, where Dotun and Aaron ran a 10K marathon for a charity. Though it was a rough first date for Aaron, Dotun (who was a track star in college) on the other hand, had a good time with the Bachelorette.</span></p><p><span>Other hopeful romantics who joined Dotun for Charity’s season of </span><i><span>The Bachelorette</span></i><span> were Sean McLaughlin, John Buresh, Tanner Courtad, Taylor Pegg, Warwick Reider, James Pierce, Aaron Schwartzman, Josh Young, Kaleb Kim, Christopher Spell, and many more.</span></p><h3><b>Dotun Olubeko Job</b></h3><p><span>Dotun Olubeko is an Integrative Medicine and Functional Health specialist. He worked full-time as a functional health consultant and performance coach, specializing in creating high-quality dietary, fitness, and lifestyle solutions that are “restorative, sustainable, and ultimately designed to optimize performance and empower individuals in their day-to-day.”</span></p><p><span>This </span><i><span>Bachelorette</span></i><span> participant also is the founder of </span><i><span>DPT Fitness</span></i><span>, a program where personalization and evidence-based dietary, fitness, and lifestyle plans meet to optimize human health. Mostly, this program approaches busy professionals and athletes through carefully curated nutrition and exercise plans along with lifestyle recommendations.</span></p><p><span>Besides </span><i><span>DPT</span></i><span>, Dotun also offered his services as a Performance Guide at </span><i><span>Lifeforce</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>Prior to this, Dotun was an Athletics Partnership Director at </span><i><span>The BodyBuilding LLC</span></i><span> for a year and a freelancing </span><i><span>Sports Nutrition Consultant</span></i><span> for 2 ½ years.</span></p><p><span>As for his education, Dotun attended C</span><i><span>alifornia State University</span></i><span>, Chico from 2015 to 2018 for his degrees in “Minor, Health and Wellness” and “Bachelor of Science – BS, Nutrition Sciences.” Then, he joined the</span><i><span> University of Western States</span></i><span> for his Master of Science in Functional Medicine & Human Nutrition from 2020 to 2022.</span></p><p><span>During his college days, Dotun was a football and track and field athlete, NCAA All-American, and professional hurdler. He also spent much of his undergrad writing meal plans for his fellow teammates and working in biochemical lab research on campus after practices.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Chicowildcats’ official page even labeled him as Chico State’s fastest 110-meter hurdler ever heading into the NCAA Championships, and a “Wildcat legend” ranked 13th in the nation heading into the Championships.</span></p><p><span>But though Dotun has an excellent track and field record, his police records weren’t so good. So far, he’s been arrested for “Driving While Suspended Or Revoked For Driving Under Influence Of Alcohol/Drugs,” Speeding, and “Unlawful To Drive Unless Licensed.”</span></p><h3><b>How Much Is Dotun Olubeko Net Worth?</b></h3><p><span>Dotun Olubeko flaunted a net worth of over $400 thousand by 2023.</span></p><h3><b>How Old Is Dotun Olubeko?</b></h3><p><span>Dotun Olubeko was 30 years of age when he appeared on </span><i><span>The Bachelorette</span></i><span> season 20 in 2023.</span></p><p><span>He is three years older than Charity Lawson.</span></p><h3><b>Dotun Olubeko Family</b></h3><p><span>Dotun Olubeko comes from a family of four.</span></p><p><span>His father, Yomi Olubeko is a retired Deputy Sheriff of Fresno Sheriff Dept.
