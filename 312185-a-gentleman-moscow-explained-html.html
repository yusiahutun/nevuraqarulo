Various readers of the same novel claim that they were inspired to read it more than once.

Anyone might be quick to think that Count had an unfulfilling life while in the Metropol Hotel. On the contrary, his life in bondage was quite rich and purposeful.</p><p class=align-left>The novel starts with Alexander being taken to the Metropol after being sentenced to house arrest. It was after this when he decided to kill himself by jumping off the roof of the building in which he was imprisoned. The suicidal idea was changed by the hotel's handyman, Abram, who shared with him about the honey that the bees that he kept on the roof had made. He told him that the honey had a taste of apples from Nizhny Novgorod, which is a place in Russia where they both grew up.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/bda29ebc190c2f5e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Former Daadab Refugee Basks in Glory of Buying House in Texas: "Our American Dream"</span></p></a><p class=align-left>After this occasion, Count changed his thoughts and befriended the employees in the hotel such as Marina, the hotel's seamstress who taught him to sew, and Anna, the famous actress in Russia.
