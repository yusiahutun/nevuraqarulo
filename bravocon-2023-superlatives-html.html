Or possibly <a href=#>Jeff Lewis</a>. But the real villain of BravoCon is F1 racing, which has made Las Vegas so much less pleasant than usual. Traffic is bonkers, there’s weird scaffolding all over the Strip, and there are bleachers in front of the Bellagio fountain. Wouldn’t it have been nice to see the cast members of Southern Charm (well … <a href=#>most of the cast</a>) posing in front of the fountain like they’d just pulled off the heist of the century? Instead, we were robbed.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clonhc2sa000e3b70lkcb6pjv@published data-word-count=100><strong>Most Fractured Existence</strong><br>Speaking of getting booed at the panel, Tom Sandoval must not know whether it’s Sunday or Judgment Day. In every room he enters, the reaction is strong. Sometimes it’s boos; sometimes it’s cheers. Riding the elevator at the hotel, he was trying to hide under a baseball cap in the corner, unlike the majority of the Bravolebrities, who were basking in the attention. Having to walk around with wrestler-heel energy thrown at you all day must be exhausting. Although, to be fair, wrestlers have their story lines written for them instead of fucking their way into heel status.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clonhj66q001b3b70brgp6yb6@published data-word-count=65><strong>Biggest Fashion Microtrend</strong><br>Red pleather! Maybe it’s all the <a href=#>Britney Spears in the air</a>, but Bravolebs went with red faux leather for their Con lewks. Lindsay Hubbard accessorized her “Oops! … I Did It Again” fit with “You’re on Your Own, Kid” <a href=#>friendship bracelets</a>. The Real Housewives of Dubai’s Taleen Marie and Winter House’s Sam Feher even wore the same red-leather flower mini on day two.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clonhmj3i001h3b70f5fl8sz1@published data-word-count=50><strong>Biggest Swiftie Crossover</strong><br>Someone had to explain that the reason everyone was giving out friendship bracelets is <a href=#>because of Taylor Swift</a>. There was even a person wearing an enormous one around her torso that read BRAVOCON. Oh, and thanks to the fan who personally made me one that said Countess Crackerjacks.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clonhmw0x001w3b70yvd8abmf@published data-word-count=49><strong>Best News</strong><br>Andrea Denver decided to break some news on my Summer House panel when he revealed he’s engaged to Lexi Sundin. (“Just don’t cancel it,” Lindsay Hubbard shot back.) But the real best news is that <a href=#>Guerdy Abraira is currently cancer free</a>! Here on Bravo, we kill all cancer.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clonhmzig00223b70i4c145cx@published data-word-count=52><strong>Most Disruptive Inanimate Object</strong><br>Below Deck Down Under’s disco-ball helmet won Most Iconic Item of the Year at the inaugural Bravos, but it was Vicki Gunvalson who pulled an orange out of her sleeve to cap off her Wifetime Achievement Award acceptance speech. Who knew prop comedy was one of her many talents?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clonhnecc00273b70ejv2h01y@published data-word-count=59><strong>Weirdest Sighting</strong><br>After the Bravos wrapped and the fans filtered outside, not only did I spot Slade Smiley among the slot machines, but I also saw Luis Ruelas with a pack of three Rick Owens–wearing hangers-on. You know how sometimes in a movie, there’s a character that’s the Devil incarnate? Luis looked just like that. Rosemary’s Baby on the loose.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clonhnlhx002e3b70pmmwnn8q@published data-word-count=36><strong>Weirdest Disturbance</strong><br>During a fraught Vanderpump Rules panel, half of the audience got up and started screaming like Ramona Singer took a shit on the floor. It was just Ken Todd lumbering in to take his seat.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clonhnxfl002s3b70em4m45m6@published data-word-count=18><strong>Most Obvious Moment</strong><br>The Real Housewives of Miami panel got a late start. Why? Lisa Hochstein was late. Duh.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clonho6hy002y3b70vwk8eju3@published data-word-count=55><strong>Spiciest Panel</strong><br>The Real Housewives of Potomac panel started with Karen Huger saying, “Robyn Dixon makes no sense on this platform.” Yes, she meant Robyn’s slot on the show, and, damn — she just came for Robyn’s job. It was downhill from there. The show basically came to life, and that was exactly what we wanted.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clonho6hy002z3b704uwr505r@published data-word-count=68><strong>Worst Accent</strong><br>Jerry O’Connell introduced half the cast of The Real Housewives of New Jersey doing his best Tony Soprano. Or possibly Bugs Bunny. It would sneak back in occasionally as he moderated the panel, so props for committing to the bit? Let the record state that this man was born in Manhattan, though, so this feels a little more bridge-and-tunnel slanderous than if someone else had done it.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clonho6hz00303b70ewyhnwmt@published data-word-count=64><strong>Best Choreography</strong><br>Erika Jayne and her creative director, Mikey Minden, did a panel about their years of collaboration, which ended with them teaching the entire audience some of the choreo from Erika’s Vegas residency. Then we got to see <a href=#>the trailer for the series</a> about the making of the Vegas show. Erika was just doing what she always does: giving the gays everything they want.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clonho6i900313b70fubadyzj@published data-word-count=67><strong>Most Insane Day</strong><br>Clearly Sunday. While many fan questions at the panels were civil, on the final day it’s like someone said, “She’s startin’.” One attendee asked Jennifer Aydin if she could be any further up Teresa Giudice’s ass, and another asked Kyle Richards, who had just finished crying when talking about her unraveling relationship, why she keeps foisting Teddi Mellencamp on us. Neither question was well received.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clonho6i900323b708a57xl3j@published data-word-count=53><strong>Best Merch</strong><br>James Kennedy’s “It’s Not About the Pasta” shirts were seriously well designed, but the award goes to Eddie Osefo’s line of Happy Eddie T-shirts, which were quite, as Dorit Kemsley would say, chic. They’re to advertise his upcoming cannabis line, which, sadly, was not available for purchase or sampling at the Con.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clonho6ia00333b70f79hk15i@published data-word-count=26><strong>Strangest Appearance</strong><br>Even though <a href=#>Ramona Singer was pulled from BravoCon</a> at the last minute, her daughter, Avery, still showed her face and a variety of all-khaki outfits.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clonho6ia00343b70sk5wc5sv@published data-word-count=14><strong>Strangest Disappearance</strong><br>Drew Sidora didn’t appear at the last minute.
