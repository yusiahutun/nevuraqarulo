The <a href=#>Die Hard</a> actor has excelled in his role as a devoted father, and his love for his blended family is evident in all the cute photos they’ve taken over the years.</p><p>Bruce is the dad of his five daughters through his marriages with <a href=#><strong>Demi Moore</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Emma Heming Willis</strong></a>. The Unbreakable alum and Demi experienced parenthood together after they married in 1987. The former couple welcomed Rumer in 1988, Scout in 1991 and Tallulah in 1994, but they split six years later in 2000.</p><p>Following their divorce, Bruce dated several famous women, including <strong>Brooke Burns</strong>, <strong>Aida Yespica</strong> and <strong>Karen McDougal</strong>, before finding love with Emma. After marrying in 2009, the Sixth Sense star and the professional model expanded his family when their daughter Mabel arrived in 2012. Their second child together, Evelyn, was born in 2014.</p><p>As an actor, Bruce has appeared in plenty of dramatic films like Live Free or Die Hard, Red and Armageddon, among others, but when he’s around his daughters, he’s a “totally silly,” guy, Emma exclusively told Closer&nbsp;in April 2017. More importantly, “<a href=#>he is a great father” to their girls</a>, <a href=#>Mabel and Evelyn</a>.</p><p>Though Bruce has had his hands full with his younger kiddos, he hasn’t missed out on any time with Rumer, Scout and Tallulah. In fact, the <a href=#>Golden Globe</a> winner, <a href=#>as well as his ex-wif</a>, <a href=#>spent more than a month together in quarantine</a> amid the coronavirus pandemic. At the time, the former duo’s daughter Scout <a href=#>opened up about life in lockdown</a> with her divorced mom and dad.</p><p>“It’s been really funny [having] both of my parents in the house where they raised us, which has been really cute,” she shared during <a href=#>an appearance on the “Dopey” podcast</a> in April 2020. “They’re both such nerdy, adorable, ’90s parents in a small town where they chose to have their kids and not be in L.A. It’s been pretty cute. … it’s some divine timing too, of getting this much time to hang out with them.”</p><p>Since splitting, Demi and Bruce have done an incredible job putting their differences aside for the sake of their kids. This doesn’t bother the actor’s second wife, Emma, as <a href=#>she has “so much respect”</a> for the Ghost actress.</p><p>“She welcomed me into her family like I welcomed her into ours,” Emma shared in another interview with Closer in April 2019. “I have so much respect for how Bruce and Demi worked through their divorce to be able to put their children first. I learned so much from that and grew so much from watching that.”</p><p>Demi, Emma and their kids revealed Bruce was diagnosed with <span>Aphasia, a condition that is “impacting his cognitive abilities,” in March 2022.</span></p><p><span>“This is a really challenging time for our family and we are so appreciative of your continued love, compassion and support,” they wrote on social media. “We are moving through this as a strong family unit, and wanted to bring his fans in because we know how much he means to you, as you do to him. As Bruce always says, ‘Live it up,’ and together we plan to do just that.”</span></p><p><strong>Scroll through the gallery below to see the cutest photos of Bruce and his five daughters.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46bqa6blWLEqrjLoqpmqJikwbC%2FjLCgraBdnba0ecqim6xlkqGyr7DEnWSfmZ2eubp5z6Kara2imsBw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./gold-ira-rollovers-a-step-by-step-guide.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Gold IRA Rollovers: A Step-by-Step Guide to a More Secure Future</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./342437-top-10-richest-kids-africa-net-worth-achievements-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Top 10 richest kids in Africa 2022, their net worth and achievements</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./french-montanas-solid-wallet-explains-why-he-aint-worried-bout-nothin.html>French Montanas solid wallet explains why he Aint Worried Bout Nothin Tue 5 July 2022</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-jackson-new-album-songs-for-mother-daughters.html>Alan Jackson's New Album Features Songs for His Late Mother, More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-f1cf0f18-55b5-552e-a3b7-517c726ba35c-html.html>Eagles C Jason Kelce retires after 13 seasons | National</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65b82c73268e3ecb698b458b-html.html>Resultados Progol 2213: premios y quiniela ganadora del fin de semana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-cbd-products.html>What Is It, Is It Legal, And Will It Get You High?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib.
