I didn’t want to look like a plonker. I didn’t want everyone tittering. I caught Daniel’s eye.<br></span></p><p><span>I said, “I hope this isn’t going to look like Tom Cruise and Thora Hird.” I was also concerned about what my son, Mark, would think of his mother cavorting like that. But, when he saw it, he told me he was very proud of me.’</span><br></p><p><span>The film, of course, was The Mother, Roger Michell’s highly acclaimed – and deeply controversial – 2004 tale of a grandmother’s affair with a man half her age, who also happens to be sleeping with her daughter.<br></span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/05/16/article-2325620-19C935A2000005DC-840_634x461.jpg height=461 width=634 alt="Anne Reid won't easily forget climbing into bed with Daniel Craig back in 2003" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Anne Reid won't easily forget climbing into bed with Daniel Craig back in 2003</p><p><span>Anne had been picking up countless what she calls ‘skirt-and-jumper roles’ since she left Coronation Street in 1971, where she’d played Valerie Barlow for nine years, but The Mother changed all that.<br></span></p><p><span>‘No question,’ she says. ‘I was invited to audition but it seemed a waste of time, me playing the lead in a film. I felt they’d need a name to get financial backing. But I did my best and then heard nothing for weeks.<br></span></p><p><span>Then I was offered a role in Calendar Girls, and because I didn’t think I’d be chosen for The Mother I told my agent to let Roger Michell know I wouldn’t be available. All hell broke loose. He wouldn’t hear of me pulling out. The phone was ringing off the hook. It was very satisfying.</span><br></p><p><span>‘Then I started to worry about who was going to play the younger man. Someone was suggested – I can’t say who – but I told them I wouldn’t agree to do it if they cast him. What the two of us had to do was so intimate, it really mattered that the man was right. When Roger asked me if I knew of an actor called Daniel Craig, I said I’d never heard of him. This was before James Bond. So Roger sent me a cassette of something Daniel had been in. Fifteen seconds into playing it, I leapt for&nbsp; the phone and shrieked, “Get him, for God’s sake!”’</span><br></p><p><span>The role knocked on the head all those offers to play ‘nice ladies in the kitchen making sandwiches’. She’s subsequently appeared in Doctor Who, played Barbara Cartland in a BBC4 film, which she loved, and more recently starred alongside Sir Derek Jacobi in Sally Wainwright’s bittersweet tale of autumnal love Last Tango In Halifax.<br></span></p><h2>RELATED ARTICLES</h2><ul class="rotator-pages link-xocc"><li class=rotator-prev><a href=# data-page=prev>Previous</a></li><li><a href=# data-page=1>1</a></li><li><a href=# data-page=2>2</a></li><li class=rotator-next><a href=# data-page=next>Next</a></li></ul><ul class="rotator-panels link-bogr1 linkro-ccox"><li><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/05/16/article-0-19C9312F000005DC-755_87x84.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>My haven: Louis Smith, the Olympic silver medallist and...</span></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/05/16/article-2325582-19D137FC000005DC-947_87x84.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>I had affairs all the time!

But I understood enough to know that my career was going to be a marathon, not a sprint. So I’ll always be grateful to The Mother for allowing me to demonstrate my versatility.’</span><br></p><p><span>A rare flop, relatively speaking, was the recent BBC revival of Upstairs, Downstairs, in which she played the cook Mrs Thackeray. Why does she think that didn’t work?</span></p><p><span>‘I don’t know. The success of Downton Abbey didn’t help, of course. I was sad it didn’t go to a third series although I don’t like being trapped in long-running shows, having had all that time in the Street.<br></span></p><p><span>'And I wouldn’t have been very keen on having my picture on jars of chutney and Christmas puddings, if it had come to it. But I’m delighted for Lesley Nicol. She’s one of my oldest friends. The joke is that she plays the cook, Mrs Patmore, in Downton, and I played the cook in Upstairs, Downstairs and yet neither of us can barely boil an egg.’</span><br></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/05/16/article-2325620-19C935F5000005DC-637_306x462.jpg height=462 width=306 alt="Anne puts her determination down to her boarding school upbringing while her father, a foreign correspondent, was posted to India, the Middle East, Cyprus and Beirut" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Anne puts her determination down to her boarding school upbringing while her father, a foreign correspondent, was posted to India, the Middle East, Cyprus and Beirut</p><p><span>Now Anne’s returning to her first love, with a five-night cabaret residency at London’s Crazy Coqs in Piccadilly Circus. Ever since she was a small child, all her fantasies have been about singing.</span></p><p><span>‘I used to lie in bed and imagine I was performing at the Albert Hall, not that I’d ever been there. I took lessons with a German teacher when I was quite young. But it turned out I had a very high soprano voice which I didn’t like at all. And then I went into Coronation Street and I stopped singing.’</span><br></p><p><span>And that was that – until she went to see the American singer Barbara Cook at the Donmar Warehouse in 1986. ‘I was so blown away, I went home and wrote her an ecstatic fan letter. A dozen years later, I met her at Anthony Hopkins’s birthday party on New Year’s Eve. He was a big fan of the Street, and I went with Thelma Barlow who played Mavis Wilton.’</span></p><p><span>Anne and Barbara started chatting that evening and a friendship developed. ‘She gave me the idea that one day I could put an act together of anecdotes from my life woven around relevant songs.’</span><br></p><p><span>And so comes her five-night residency in London.<br></span></p><p><span>'Not bad for someone who’ll be a week off her 78th birthday. ‘Not bad at any age,’ she counters, with a merry twinkle. ‘Mind you, I’d much rather be 45 than 77. But, as Alan Bennett says, if you get to 70 and you can still eat a boiled egg, everyone thinks you’re wonderful.’</span><br></p><p><span>In June she’ll start recording the second series of Last Tango In Halifax, which became an instant hit last November on BBC1. On paper, the prospect of two septuagenarians rekindling a teenage romance looked unpromisingly twee. ‘I get sent scripts all the time,’ she says, ‘and almost always I’d be playing someone in an old people’s home. But not everyone my age – me included – is sad and old. That’s why Sally Wainwright’s script for Last Tango was such a joy.’</span><br></p><p><span>Hard as it is to believe, given their on-screen chemistry, she and Derek Jacobi had never worked together before, never even met. ‘Well, we’re good actors,’ she says. ‘And I made a particular point of being physical with him.</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/05/16/article-2325620-0020700800000258-818_634x643.jpg height=643 width=634 alt="She married Peter Eckersley, a writer and producer with Coronation Street and ultimately head of drama at Granada, in 1971" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>She married Peter Eckersley, a writer and producer with Coronation Street and ultimately head of drama at Granada, in 1971</p><p><span>'The British tend to be uptight; they shy away from being tactile.</span><br><span>‘I remember saying to Caroline Quentin, who played my daughter in Life Begins, “Now look, I’m your mother. We’re really, really close. Put it this way, love, I breastfed you.” At which point, Caroline promptly stuck her fingers down her throat.’&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span>Anne puts her determination down to her boarding school upbringing while her father, a foreign correspondent, was posted to India, the Middle East, Cyprus and Beirut.<br></span></p><p><span>‘I was sent away to boarding school in Colwyn Bay, aged 12, which I loved but I only saw my parents once a year in the summer. It made me very self-sufficient. I’ve always been a loner, perfectly happy with my own company, although I’m very sociable, too. I write in my diary, “Spent day all alone. Wonderful!”’</span><br></p><p><span>She married Peter Eckersley, a writer and producer with Coronation Street and ultimately head of drama at Granada, in 1971. ‘Not that he ever gave me a job. I always used to say that I’d slept with the head of drama for 15 years and it did my career no good whatsoever.’</span><br></p><p><span>Peter died ten years later of cancer aged just 45. ‘It was dreadful,’ she says, ‘just dreadful. And so young. I was left with a nine-year-old son to bring up alone. My biggest worry was whether I would do right by Mark. I deliberately didn’t work for the first 12 years of his life.’</span><br></p><p><span>Now she says she wouldn’t dream of retiring. ‘Why would I? But then, I’m so lucky. I get offered a wide variety of parts. Just as well because I can’t do anything else. And, if the phone should stop ringing, I’ve always got my cabaret.’</span><br></p><p><span>Anne will be singing at Crazy Coqs,&nbsp; London W1, from 21-25 May.
