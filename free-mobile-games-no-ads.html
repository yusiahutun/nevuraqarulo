What sets DATA WING apart from other racers is the unique driving system. Your ship flies automatically, and you tap left or right to steer towards either direction.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>To apply brakes, simply tap both sides at the same time. You can also thrust off walls, using the momentum to your advantage to pass other racers.</p><p>Though DATA WING is about racing, it does have a story spanning two hours with 40 levels to complete.

The graphics are beautiful and pull you into the fascinating world of energy and electricity.</p><p>In OHM, you'll learn about energy and how it works. It explains how energy becomes electricity from an atomic level, working its way up to more significant objects, like transportation. The game comprises several puzzle-based chapters featuring different topics that it explains in a fun and interactive way.</p><p>OHM's puzzles are mostly straightforward, but that's what you'd expect from a game that's supposed to serve an educational purpose. But as the learning progresses, the puzzles get trickier. It never gets too complicated, though, making the game perfect for children.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>After all, who said you couldn't have fun and learn something simultaneously? It really is among the best iPhone games without ads.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> OHM - A Virtual Science Centre for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a> (Free)</p><h2 id=pewpew>6. PewPew</h2><p>Love Geometry Wars but don't feel like paying a premium? PewPew lets you experience multidirectional shoot-em-up action at no cost.</p><p>The graphics in PewPew are basic, but if you crave bright neon shape outlines against a black background, it's perfect. PewPew has a high frame rate and features five different game modes: Pandemonium, Dodge This, Assault, Chromatic Conflict, and Asteroids.</p><p>Pandemonium includes enemies that explode or spin maniacally upon death, causing chaos for you. Dodge This challenges you to collect boxes while avoiding enemies. Assault is like classic Geometry Wars, where you fight waves of enemies.</p><p>Chromatic Conflict involves killing only enemies that match your ship's current color, which gets a bit tricky and requires observation and patience. Finally, Asteroids is like the classic game of the same name that you've probably played before.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>As if these game modes aren't enough, PewPew also has playable ships to unlock and leaderboards to climb. It's incredible how this game is free with no strings attached.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> PewPew on <a href=#>Android</a> | <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a> (Free)</p><h2 id=underhand>7. Underhand</h2><p>Want something completely free but also unique? Then check out Underhand by Spoopy Squad—there's nothing else like it.</p><p>Underhand bills itself as a CCG, which usually stands for "collectible card game," but here stands for "cultist card game." That means you take on the role of a cult leader and must manage your cult's resources effectively.</p><p>Meanwhile, you must respond to various event cards drawn from the deck. Your response to events determines the success of your cult and how far it will go.</p><p>Your cult's primary goal is to summon an "Ancient One," but again, this depends on your resource management and success. Otherwise, the cult may fall prey to the trials and tribulations of time itself. Either way, Underhand provides a thrilling choice-based adventure that anyone can enjoy.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>We recommend you carefully go through the tutorial initially because otherwise, you'll likely end up getting lost. However, once you start playing, it's hard to stop.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> Underhand by Spoopy Squad for <a href=#>Android</a> (Free)</p><h2 id=simon-tatham-39-s-puzzles>8.
