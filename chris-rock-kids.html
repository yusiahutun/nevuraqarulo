If you’ve watched <a href=# id=auto-tag_chris-rock data-tag=chris-rock>Chris Rock</a>‘s Netflix comedy special, you might be wondering <a href=# rel=noopener>who are Chris Rock’s kids?&nbsp;</a></p><p>Chris went into deep detail about the infamous <a href=# rel=noopener>Oscars Slap</a>. Throughout his set, Chris teased some jokes alluding to the slap by saying “words hurt. Anybody who says that words hurt has never been punched in the face.” He ended his set by calling Will “Suge Smith”, a reference to the currently-incarcerated Death Row Records CEO Suge Knight, who was sentenced to 28 years in prison in 2018 for manslaughter. Rock was taking out his anger over his wife’s “entanglement’ with musician August Alsina which was discussed on her show Red Table Talk in 2020.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/dave-chappelle-1.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Corinne-Foxx-Annalise-Bishop-Jamie-Foxx.png><p>He also included a scathing anecdote about his daughter in his set. So, who are Chris Rock’s kids? Read more below to find out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Chris-Rock-kids-.jpg><p>Chris Rock has two kids with ex-wife Malaak Compton Rock. He cited the 9/11 attacks as a reason why he wanted to start a family <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">to Oprah.</a> “Our child is such a 9/11 baby. I said to myself, “The world’s falling down, and what have I done with my life?” We’ve been married five years, but we’ve never planned anything—it has always been about today. After September 11, I said, “It’s time. Let’s have a baby.” He talks about being a family man most of the time. “In my normal life, I’m just with my kids most of the time,” he told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> in December 2013. “I’m a writer at heart. Writing is a nerd job. There’s nothing cool about writing. Hemingway, I don’t care who it is.”</p><p>Chris <a href=# rel=noopener>filed for divorce</a> in 2014. “After much contemplation and 19 years of marriage, Chris and I have decided to go our separate ways. Being fortunate enough to lead a life of service by working with those most vulnerable makes me well aware of life’s blessings, even when faced with difficulties,” Malaak said in a statement at the time. “While recognizing that this is a significant change, my <a href=# id=auto-tag_children data-tag=children>children</a> remain at the center of my life and their well-being is my top priority. It is in this spirit that I sincerely ask that their privacy and the privacy of our family be respected during this transition in our lives.”</p><p>Divorce papers obtained by&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Page Six</a> say the parents agreed to 50-50 child custody. The court filings say Compton-Rock deserves a payout “commensurate with the marital standard of living” because of all her child-rearing and charitable endeavors.</p><h2>Lola Simone Rock</h2><p>Birthday: June 28, 2002</p><p>Lola Simone Rock is Chris Rock’s first daughter. She was born on June 28, 2002, and is studying documentary filmmaking in college and according to Chris, it “means I’m going to be lending her lots of money.”</p><p>She graduated from Bergen Passiac chapter of Jack & Jill of America, according to her mom’s Instagram, “My oldest daughter Lola Simone graduated from the Bergen Passaic chapter of Jack & Jill of America this past weekend!” Malaak <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>wrote on June 3, 2020</a>. “Jack and Jill has a mission to nurture future African-American leaders by strengthening children through leadership development, volunteer service, philanthropic giving, and civic duty. … The senior teen advisors outdid themselves with a wonderful surprise drive-by celebration and a moving and enriching Zoom graduation ceremony. Fantastic surprises included a memorable, wisdom-filled speech by&nbsp;MC Lyte and a surprise visit from Will Smith!” The event which of course was two years before the Oscars Slap.</p><p>Lola was a large subject in Chris’ comedy special Selective Outrage. He recounted “My kids ski, they ride horses…they fence, I got fencing little Black girls” When she was on a school trip in Portugal during her senior year, “Lola and four of her little white girlfriends decided they were bored.” The girls, he said, ended up sneaking out to go drinking and got caught. “Of course, they got busted. Rich white schools, they don’t play that shit.”</p><p>He continued, “These crazy white schools got rich ass white parents and rich ass white parents do not let their kids get kicked out of school. So all the parents, they all got lawyers, even the ones that were lawyers got lawyers. Good lawyers.”</p><p>Chris refused to get a lawyer because he was “mad” at his daughter. “But my ex-wife’s like, ‘No, f— that, we’re getting a lawyer, and we’re gonna sue this school, we’re gonna sue this dean, we can sue these teachers. I can’t even believe they let her out of their sight!'”</p><p><span>He referenced his divorce, “I started to argue but the last time I argued with my ex-wife about a lawyer, I lost my house,” he joked. “So I come home from work and I see Lola outside just laughing with like three of her little white girlfriends.” He said he then walked over to find out what was so funny, and her reply was not exactly what he wanted to hear.</span></p><p>“Lola is like, ‘Daddy stop it, you’re so serious! I’ll be back in school in no time,'” he continued. He then got into his car, drove to the school and asked the dean a favor: “I need you to kick my daughter out of this school. I need you to kick her Black ass out of this school. I need my Black child to learn her lesson right now before she is up on OnlyFans and some s—! Please kick my child out of f—ing school.” In the end, Chris said, “They kicked her out. They kicked them all out, but they kicked my child out first.”</p><h2>Zahra Savannah Rock</h2><p>Birthday: March 16, 2004</p><p>Zahra Savannah Rock is Chris Rock and Malaak Compton-Rock’s second child. She was born on March 16, 2004. Zahra is studying at the American University of Paris through the University of Southern California.</p><p>“Paris is beginning to feel like home. After 20 years of visiting this amazing city as a tourist, I now visit like a semi-local!” her mother posted on Instagram. “With my oldest daughter in her junior year of university and my middle daughter doing an exchange, I have ample reason to visit!”</p><p>She also posted a birthday tribute on her <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">17th birthday</a>. “All she wanted was to have a joint family lunch at her favorite restaurant and to hang out with her closest girlfriends watching movies, talking and laughing into the night! I continue to be so amazed and blessed by her selfless nature, love for humanity, sweet personality and activist spirit. I love you Zaza! Happy birthday sweetheart!”</p><p><i>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
