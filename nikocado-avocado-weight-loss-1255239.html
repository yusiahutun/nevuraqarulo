Popular for his food-chewing live streams, YouTuber Nikocado Avocado has come into the spotlight for shifting his video content from food-binging to healthy dieting. Nikocado Avocado‚Äôs weight loss attempt and journey has come as a surprise to his fans who enjoyed his mukbangs but also showed concerns for his health. Crispy chicken crunches or slurpy saucy noodles, the sensory and tingling mukbang binges never fail to grab attention. However, the intake of an entire menu in one go has inevitable repercussions that Nikocado realized over time, and after several episodes of severe mental breakdowns, he began incorporating positive changes in his life, taking control of his health.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Who is Nikocado Avocado?</strong></h3><p lang=en dir=ltr>I just want someone to look at me the way Nikocado avocado looks at his cheeseburger‚Äôsü•∞üòÇ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/tHF6FoRrBR</a></p>‚Äî Jennifer Martinez (@Renajenjen1364) <a href=#>October 11, 2023</a><p>Nicholas Perry, famously known as Nikocado Avocado is an American YouTuber, born, on May 19, 1992, in Ukraine. While he was a child, he was adopted and brought up in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. While trying his luck in the music space, living in New York, Perry met his husband Orlin Home. After dropping the music path, Perry began his YouTube career, sharing content on his vegan lifestyle. In 2016, he stopped filming and supporting veganism, after realizing that his body had adverse effects and stepped into the K-culture world of mukbangs. With his episodes of consuming huge portions of fast food and a touch of drama, Perry gained immense popularity and currently has over 7 million subscribers across a total of four channels.&nbsp;</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p>As mentioned by Nicholas in interviews, he has faced setbacks pertaining to his mental and physical health. From being diagnosed with ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder) and OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder) in his pre-teen years to facing challenges of obesity with mukbangs and extreme eating trends, Perry stirred concerns among his fans. Soon enough, he went on to lose weight and focus on a healthy lifestyle. Read on to know what unfolded next.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Why Did Nikocado Avocado Gain Weight?</strong></h3><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>#NikocadoAvocado</a>‚Äôs before and after pictures expose the truth about his weight loss üßê<a href=#>https://t.co/K02h0eICh9</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/I9N8EI30wV</a></p>‚Äî Sportsmanor (@sports_manor) <a href=#>May 1, 2023</a><p>Nicholas‚Äô weight gain can be directly attributed to his enormously gluttonous and fast-food-packed diet. This kind of diet goes hand in hand with the mukbang influencer trend. This genre of videos entails a series of podcasts where a person eats a great quantity of food in front of a camera, while also recording ASMR (Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response) ‚Äî chewing, slurping, and unpacking noises. While such episodes garner widespread attention, they usually have adverse effects on the creator‚Äôs health. For years, Nicholas consumed fast and junk food for the sake of his channel. The high cholesterol and fat menu with a lack of workouts, made Perry gain weight (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Nikocado Avocado Weight Loss: Behind the Scene of YouTube Mukbangs ","1255239","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6196377/","articlepage","/health/weight-loss/nikocado-avocado-weight-loss-1255239","1","Body_Hyperlink","health","weight-loss")'><u>1</u></a>). These items included Korean noodles, burgers, pizzas, fries, crispy chicken, steaks, and desserts. The range extended to all sorts of international meals too. Before embarking on his weight loss journey, Perry weighed approximately 320 pounds.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>How Did Nikocado Avocado Lose Weight Loss?</strong></h3><p lang=en dir=ltr>Warms my heart to see Nikocado Avocado losing weight.

The way he gained immense weight and found himself struggling with daily chores was very alarming and called for action. On March, 23, he posted a vlog on his YouTube, stating that he had lost 89 pounds. Perry did not go overboard with broadcasting his weight loss secrets; however, he mentioned that he did not necessarily count his calories as he does not believe in maintaining a record of everything that he ate throughout the day. His diet comprised fried rice and potatoes. Perry also credited going on walks as a contributing factor in his weight loss. The fans and followers were quick to notice the changes in his body and went on to fully support and cheer him. Most of the time, Nicholas is munching on packed snacks called takis. The fans also noticed how Perry paired his chips with vegan and cholesterol-free dips.&nbsp;</p><p>Only after a month of announcing that he is invested in striving for a healthy life, in April, he posted yet another video talking about how he again gained 30 pounds ‚Äî he was seen crying and sobbing in the video. Fortunately, his audiences kept on motivating him to lose weight and ditch his binging, as he currently weighs 352 pounds. Some of the commenters also went on to praise him for being able to move around freely, since he struggled to even do so.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Here‚Äôs How Fans Reacted to Nikocado‚Äôs Weight Loss</strong></h3><p>Even though Nikocado‚Äôs plausible weight loss only lasted for a short while, his fans were convinced that Nikocado could achieve success through his continued hard work.

The YouTuber gained excessive weight due to his mukbang menus. The key takeaway from Perry‚Äôs story is to realize how fast food can have adverse effects on one‚Äôs health and lead to issues like obesity, lethargy, and immobility.</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p class=also_read_style><strong>ALSO READ:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# onclick='triggerCommentfollowAlsoClick("article_also_read_click","Nikocado Avocado Weight Loss: Behind the Scene of YouTube Mukbangs ",1255239,"https://www.pinkvilla.com/lifestyle/health-fitness/christina-aguilera-diet-to-weight-loss-1213928","articlepage","/health/weight-loss/nikocado-avocado-weight-loss-1255239","Content Also read","health","weight-loss"),triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Nikocado Avocado Weight Loss: Behind the Scene of YouTube Mukbangs ",1255239,"https://www.pinkvilla.com/lifestyle/health-fitness/christina-aguilera-diet-to-weight-loss-1213928","articlepage","/health/weight-loss/nikocado-avocado-weight-loss-1255239","Christina Aguilera‚Äôs Weight Loss Journey ‚Äì The Incredible Transformation","Also_Read","health","weight-loss")'><strong>Christina Aguilera‚Äôs Weight Loss Journey ‚Äì The Incredible Transformation</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sbXNpK2ipJyWe6S7zGifnpmcqbVww8SinqGsXaG8tL%2BOp6Ckp5OWsbB5wK%2BmnJmUpHq4scign61lnKTAtHmQa2xuamNu</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-does-it-mean-to-dream-about-snail-teaching-you-the-value-of-patience.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What does it mean to dream about Snail teaching you the value of patience</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./nicola-coughlan-shares-reaction-bridgerton-season-3.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>Nicola Coughlan shares reaction to Bridgerton season 3 news following backlash</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./french-montanas-solid-wallet-explains-why-he-aint-worried-bout-nothin.html>French Montanas solid wallet explains why he Aint Worried Bout Nothin Tue 5 July 2022</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-jackson-new-album-songs-for-mother-daughters.html>Alan Jackson's New Album Features Songs for His Late Mother, More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-f1cf0f18-55b5-552e-a3b7-517c726ba35c-html.html>Eagles C Jason Kelce retires after 13 seasons | National</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65b82c73268e3ecb698b458b-html.html>Resultados Progol 2213: premios y quiniela ganadora del fin de semana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-cbd-products.html>What Is It, Is It Legal, And Will It Get You High?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib.
