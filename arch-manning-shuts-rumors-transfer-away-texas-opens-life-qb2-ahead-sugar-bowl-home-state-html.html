But after spending a season on the bench, some wondered if he'd look to move elsewhere.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>During media availability before the Longhorns' matchup with Washington in the Sugar Bowl, Manning shut those rumors down - committing to staying at Texas and learning under Steve Sarkisian.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>"Obviously, there's always rumors, especially nowadays, but I haven't looked into transferring at all," Manning told reporters.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>"I'm just focused on developing and helping this team in any way I can. Hopefully, one day playing for the University of Texas like I've always wanted to."</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>When asked if his father would try to get big-money offers to lure him away, Arch replied, 'I don't think it's about money right now.</p><img id=i-79950117f3c62726 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/12/30/22/79468825-12913205-image-a-54_1703976719967.jpg height=413 width=634 alt="Arch Manning is back in his home state of Louisiana in the Superdome with Texas" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Arch Manning is back in his home state of Louisiana in the Superdome with Texas</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I want to develop from Sark. I was told that good things happening to good people who work hard and put their head down and that's what I'm focused on right now."&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Arch is from Louisiana footballing royalty - which makes Monday's game played in New Orleans all the more exciting for him.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He's familiar with the Caesars Superdome as well: a building where he played a state championship game with Isidore Newman High School.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Of course, it's also a place where his grandfather - Archie Manning - played quarterback for the Saints for many years.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>"It's nice being back in town," Manning said. "He's my biggest role model, getting to practice and eventually play where he played is super special."&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>His uncles Peyton and Eli Manning have also played there in the past.&nbsp;Arch said all year, the two Super Bowl champions sent him encouragement over text message as he waited his turn to take the field.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Now, that turn could be a lot closer than it was at the beginning of the season. Arch is still a backup, but now he's moved up the depth chart.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>That's because backup Maalik Murphy hit the transfer portal, making Arch the new QB2 for the Longhorns.&nbsp;</p><img id=i-106117a11116282c src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/12/30/22/79468833-12913205-image-a-56_1703976728464.jpg height=423 width=634 alt="Manning said that he isn't planning on transferring away from Texas any time soon" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Manning said that he isn't planning on transferring away from Texas any time soon</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>If anything happened to starter Quinn Ewers, Arch would be the next in line - something that recent history says is perfectly possible.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Take Ohio State for example. Starting quarterback Kyle McCord transferred to Syracuse before the team played in Friday night's Cotton Bowl Classic, leaving QB2 Devin Brown to start.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But Brown went down early with an injury, leaving coach Ryan Day to put in freshman Lincoln Keinholz. The Buckeyes would go on to lose to Missouri.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>That's left Arch to prepare for disaster - and to make sure that he's as ready as he'll ever be for this game.<br></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>"I've tried to prepare like I'm the starter every week, but I guess now that you're just one play away instead of two, there's a little more to be prepared for," Manning said.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>"A lot of it is mental just because you're watching, you've got to get mental reps and just trying to prepare like you're the starter because there's a good chance you play.&nbsp;</p><img id=i-564b15cc8274ff61 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/12/30/22/79468831-12913205-image-a-55_1703976724356.jpg height=423 width=634 alt="After the departure of backup Maalik Murphy, Manning is now the QB2 for the Longhorns" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>After the departure of backup Maalik Murphy, Manning is now the QB2 for the Longhorns</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>There's also a good chance you don't play, but at the end of the day, it's just football, going out there, doing what I've done my whole life.
