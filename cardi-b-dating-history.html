At the time, the Bronx-born rapper shared photos of a new butterfly tattoo covering up a man’s name—naturally, Bardi Gang was quick to investigate. Followers flooded the “Wap” rapper’s page with replies once they realized that the name likely belonged to one of Cardi’s exes. It got us thinking: Who else has Cardi dated that we don’t really know about yet?</p><p>In response to <a href=#>Cardi’s new tattoo</a>, one Twitter user was quick to point out that “she said that she have [sic] tattoos of her past boyfriends on ellen before.” And they’re right—in a past appearance on the Ellen DeGeneres Show, Cardi once revealed, “I have like three different men tatted on me, you know what I’m saying? They gotta go!” While we might not know exactly how many men Cardi’s dated before she married Offset, her longest public relationship, in September 2017, at least a few is a good place to start.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/50-cent.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/cardi-b-1.png><p>So, we did some digging—and what we found was pretty surprising! There are some commonalities: <a href=#>Cardi’s relationship with Offset</a> takes after the others in that she’s been linked to other rappers in the past. And like Offset, some of Cardi’s former flames may have served time. While Offset’s since transitioned into full-on Daddy duty to his and <a href=#>Cardi’s daughter, Kulture</a>, the same can’t be said for Cardi’s exes.</p><p>For everything we know about Cardi’s alleged exes—from their hookups to their drama—keep on reading.</p><p>A version of this article was originally published in July 2020.</p><h2>DJ Self (2015)</h2><p>Long before <a href=# id=auto-tag_cardi-b data-tag=cardi-b>Cardi B</a> dropped her Grammy-winning album,&nbsp;Invasion of Privacy,&nbsp;in 2018, the “Be Careful” starlet was clawing her way to the top of the rap game on VH1’s&nbsp;Love & Hip-Hop.&nbsp;The former stripper was vocal even then about her struggles in the industry, and frequently called out the people who kept her down. And that included Power 105 radio personality, DJ Self.</p><p>According to Cardi, DJ Self was “the hottest DJ in New York or whatever,” so she tolerated a casual relationship where she slept with him occasionally. A 2018 Complex feature notes that “she was willing to deal with him seeing other women so long as he helped get her music played,” but unfortunately, DJ Self disappointed in that department, too.</p><h2>King Yella (2015)</h2><p>After Offset and Cardi’s whirlwind year of infidelity and sex tape rumors in 2017, another rapper came out of the woodwork to allege that he’d had an affair with the “Bodak Yellow” star. In a January 2018 diss track titled “Cardi B Truth,” the 29-year-old Chicago-based rapper claimed that “Cardi B wanna have my baby,” and suggested that she slept with him. He also posted screenshots of a FaceTime conversation he appeared to have with the star.</p><p>However, Cardi shut down the rumors quickly. The “Bartier Cardi” rapper shared a heated phone call on social media, where could be heard telling Yella that she never slept with him. “You tried to make it seem like I did, and I never did,” she said, adding, “I’ve never kissed you. I’ve never nothing.”</p><h2>Tommy Geez (2015-2016)</h2><p>Cardi’s relationship with fellow rapper and&nbsp;Love & Hip Hop star&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Tommy Geez</a> was by far her most prominent yet before her marriage to now-husband, Offset. The pair dated for around a year while the young rapper got her start on&nbsp;LHH,&nbsp;but broke up once her career began taking off. And that’s probably for the better.</p><p>Since their split, Geez has been involved in some pretty serious crimes. In 2017, the rapper was released from prison after serving on gun possession charges. But by 2019, he was involved in another shocking crime: Geez reportedly ran over a man and his eight-year-old son before slashing the man and driving away.</p><p>Still, it’s possible Cardi remained interested in Geez during one of her splits from Offset. Following the rapper’s release from prison and <a href=#>Offset’s cheating scandal</a> in 2017, Cardi followed Geez again on Instagram. At the time, Cardi posted a cryptic message on Instagram that read: “I still think about you.”</p><h2>Offset (2017 – 2020)</h2><p>Cardi and Offset met in 2017 after the Migos rapper took a liking to her. Their first date was at Super Bowl LI, Offset famously confirmed to&nbsp;Rolling Stone. By October 2017, the pair were publically engaged (In 2018,&nbsp; Cardi confirmed that she and Offset had actually already gotten secretly married in September).</p><p>Yet a series of <a href=#>cheating scandals</a> emerged over the course of the next few months after footage from Offset’s iCloud was publically leaked. After fielding those rumors for months, Cardi revealed she was expecting a baby with the Migos rapper during a performance on SNL. The couple have since welcomed baby Kulture, but their happiness was shortlived: Cardi and Offset officially split a few months after her birth.</p><p>“I’ve been trying to work things out with my baby’s father for a hot minute now,” Cardi said in a video she shared on Instagram in December 2018. “We’re really good friends and we’re really good business partners … we’ve got a lot of love for each other but things just haven’t been working out between us for a long time.”</p><p>She added, “And it’s nobody’s fault, I guess we just grew out of love, but we’re not together anymore.”</p><p>While Cardi hinted at divorce at the time, the couple were able to work on their issues—until September 2020 when Cardi filed to divorce her husband after almost three years together. In her divorce filing, Cardi claimed that her and Offset’s marriage was ”irretrievably broken” and that there were “no prospects for a reconciliation.” Cardi also sought primary physical and legal custody of Kulture.</p><h2>Samuel</h2><p>Nobody really knows who Samuel is, but clearly, he was special enough to Cardi to get his name tattooed on her body. The “I Like It” rapper dropped the bombshell on Twitter in mid-2020, when she shared a photo of the since-covered tat.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/entertainment-newsletter-banner.jpg alt="New Entertainment Newsletter" width=670 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2iblaGyo77IrbBmppWswHB9kGxraWxiZLCivsOiZJtllJbBqrrGZp%2Biq6Skv7p7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./39-facts-about-gemma-chan.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>39 Facts About Gemma Chan</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./trader-pleads-not-guilty-us100-million-hacking-case-us.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Trader pleads not guilty in US$100 million hacking case in US</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./french-montanas-solid-wallet-explains-why-he-aint-worried-bout-nothin.html>French Montanas solid wallet explains why he Aint Worried Bout Nothin Tue 5 July 2022</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-jackson-new-album-songs-for-mother-daughters.html>Alan Jackson's New Album Features Songs for His Late Mother, More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-f1cf0f18-55b5-552e-a3b7-517c726ba35c-html.html>Eagles C Jason Kelce retires after 13 seasons | National</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65b82c73268e3ecb698b458b-html.html>Resultados Progol 2213: premios y quiniela ganadora del fin de semana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-cbd-products.html>What Is It, Is It Legal, And Will It Get You High?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib.
