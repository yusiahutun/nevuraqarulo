"Instead, we were devastated with news that has broken us to our core.</p><p>"At approximately 8am, My brother, Marvin, received a phone call that no one ever wants to receive. He was contacted by a judge in Aransas Pass, Texas that a tragedy had taken place. We were told that there was an incident that had taken the lives of our Mother (Jana Colburn would be 53 today), Father (William "Buck" Colburn Jr. 62), Little Sister (Emma Colburn 13) and Brother (William "Quince" Colburn III 15).</p><p>"As you can imagine, this is hard for us right now. This is not something we ever imagined to happen. We were not prepared for 1 loss, yet alone 4. Especially our siblings. We are hurt. We do not understand. We are lost. We are angry.
