McQueen was inspired by the 1969 film They Shoot Horses, Don't They? about Depression-era dance competitions where people would cut a rug for cash prizes, sometimes until they died of exhaustion. McQueen’s models mimicked this desperate dancing. At first, they appeared in ball gowns, doing gleeful high kicks; later, they dragged their limbs down the runway in tailored patchwork blazers. I’ve watched the video countless times, and it always reminds me that the fashion world now doesn’t contain nearly as much performance as it did during that era, when McQueen and John Galliano at Dior were giving audiences bona fide drama alongside fantastic clothes.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And then, this past New York Fashion Week, there was Wiederhoeft.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Designer Jackson Wiederhoeft has been known to stage exuberant shows that feel more like short-form experimental plays than runway. They’re inspired by fantastical things, like the fable of Orpheus and Eurydice or fairies dancing in a jewelry box. And while he always puts on a show, what he does reminds me less of the darkness of McQueen and more of the quirkiness of Thom Browne, a designer he worked under for five years after getting a start designing costumes for Off Broadway productions.</p><img alt="new york, new york september 12 models perform on the runway at the wiederhoeft fashion show during new york fashion week at the la mama experimental theater on september 12, 2023 in new york city photo by steven ferdmangetty images" title="Wiederhoeft - Runway - New York Fashion Week - September 2023" width=3030 height=4545 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1676624324-65033c08b828c.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Steven Ferdman</span><p>The leading lady of Wiederhoeft’s Spring 2024 show, walking on a runway made of chairs</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Wiederhoeft’s Spring 2024 collection was titled “Night Terror at the Opera” and presented at La Mama, an experimental theater on East 4th Street in Manhattan. As guests took their seats, many could be seen snapping pictures of Julia Fox, a longtime fan of the brand who sat in the front row. In a corset minidress with bows encircling her hips, she vaped under her veil, its thick white tulle gathering at her feet like ricotta on toast.</p><img alt="new york, new york september 12 julia fox attends the wiederhoeft fashion show during new york fashion week at la mama experimental theatre on september 12, 2023 in new york city photo by paul morigigetty images" title="Wiederhoeft - Front Row &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; Backstage - New York Fashion Week - September 2023" width=4000 height=6000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1676557165-65033cc1c1b5e.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Paul Morigi</span><p>Julia Fox in a frothy Wiederhoeft wedding creation with a bag that reads “Till Death Do Us Part”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When the lights went down, a red spotlight revealed a row of folding chairs arranged in a semicircle at the center of the stage. Models emerged from backstage to take their seats, and a woman identified in the program as a leading lady materialized in a corseted plum double-faced silk satin dress, her skirt hand-embroidered with dark plum cut-glass beads matching those of her opera gloves and purse.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The looks that followed were equally dramatic: a long-sleeved column dress hand-embroidered with cut-glass beads and bicone crystal fringe spelling out “Wonder Memories, Dreams of Our Love, Together Forever,” for example, or a Victorian dress in white silk mikado with a large bow outline in black sequin and bead embroidery. There were even a poodle bride and groom (there’s always a poodle somewhere at Wiederhoeft), their wedding attire lined with ruffled tulle pom-poms.</p><img alt=wiederhoeft title=wiederhoeft width=2837 height=4256 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/wiederhoeft-lb-wss24-038-65033d0a71abd.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Wiederhoeft</span><p>Wiederhoeft’s tulle-covered “poodle groom” and “poodle bride”</p><img alt="new york, usa september 12 a model walks the runway during the wiederhoeft ready to wear springsummer 2024 fashion show as part of the new york fashion week on september 12, 2023 in ny photo by victor virgilegamma rapho via getty images" title="Wiederhoeft - Runway - Spring/Summer 2024 New York Fashion Week" width=4256 height=2837 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1677731289-65033bf70ffa1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Victor Virgile</span><p>A “pop star” surrounded by her entourage wearing “security” tank tops, an item fashion editors in the audience swooned over</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And yet, when the show was over, everyone kept mentioning something that was far more down-to-earth: the matching tanks worn by the muscled entourage of a “pop star” in a long peach bias-cut dress. The tanks were ribbed and black, with lace-trim spaghetti straps and the word “Security” embroidered in sparkling crystal.</p><img alt="new york, usa september 12 a model walks the runway during the wiederhoeft ready to wear springsummer 2024 fashion show as part of the new york fashion week on september 12, 2023 in ny photo by victor virgilegamma rapho via getty images" title="Wiederhoeft - Runway - Spring/Summer 2024 New York Fashion Week" width=2837 height=4256 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1677729855-65033bde4fc19.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Victor Virgile</span><p>Three models described in the show notes as “Sassy 1,” “Sassy 2,” and “Sassy 3” wearing trompe l’oeil goodness</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Other very wearable Wiederhoeft pieces came in the form of a hand-embroidered trompe l’oeil corset top and a sequined skirt with bugle beads sketching out a garter belt and panties. During the runway segment, the designer also showed a white cotton rib knit with “heiress” written out in italics using hotfix crystals. It felt like something Anna Delvey would request for one of her rooftop photo shoots.</p><img alt="wiederhoeft nyfw show" title="wiederhoeft nyfw show" width=2837 height=4256 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/wiederhoeft-lb-wss24-028-65033c6a0d9a2.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Wiederhoeft</span><p>A model wearing an “heiress” top with a sequined skirt—which feels, as the kids would say, very “Anna Delvey–core”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Of course, because of market forces, today’s fashion can never look like the fashion that was current when I learned to walk. These days it has to be commercial. If you’re a new designer, you need one It piece that everyone buys to help fund your creative vision, like Luar’s Ana bag or Collina Strada’s tie-dye sweatshirts. Wiederhoeft has an adoring New York community of fans who wear his looks to his shows, but these fun little security tanks feel like an easier way to let more people into his weird, wondrous world.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I can already see it now: A group of downtown girls sipping martinis at a New York haunt like Balthazar or the Odeon, the reflective light of the “Security” crystals bouncing off the frames of their wraparound sunglasses. People who have never heard of Wiederhoeft will laugh at the playfulness of the top, whereas others will nod with IYKYK approval. And that kind of performance will likely come to define the era of fashion more acutely than anything that happens on a stage.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 e1jtuqk11"></span><h5 class="css-13733z5 e1jtuqk13">Wiederhoeft Spring 2024</h5><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 e1jtuqk10"></span><img alt=wiederhoeft src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/wiederhoeft-lb-wss24-001-65030a32ed278.jpg title=wiederhoeft width=2837 height=4256 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/a3e534fd-dc82-4b22-be80-50efa84b1924_1663767759.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Tara Gonzalez" title="Headshot of Tara Gonzalez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Tara Gonzalez is the Senior Fashion Editor at Harper’s Bazaar.
