I’m trying to plot what the future could look like and what the possibilities are but the reality is that he’s getting on and this is the purple patch of his career,” Whyte said.</p><p>“The sad thing is reality bites and he’s not getting any younger, so he’s at an age now where in another year you might have missed the boat.</p><h3><a href=# data-entity-uuid=0fbac3e2-a74b-4e68-8f03-7b5ac3b8301c data-entity-type=node data-entity-bundle=article>Will Power heads off for deserved break after landing eighth dirt win</a></h3><p>“It’s a tough pill to swallow but it’s not only me that’s got Covid problems and we’re just very fortunate that we’re still racing.”</p><p>It’s not only Will Power who’s been prevented from travelling, with Covid-19 setting in during Whyte’s first season as a trainer, and the 13-time champion jockey is itching for the opportunity to test himself as a handler abroad.</p><p>“I haven’t travelled before but I’m going to do that and this could have been the perfect horse for that first opportunity,” he said.</p><p>“He would have been the perfect horse to travel with because he’s tough and so honest – he goes to Happy Valley, he goes to Conghua and he doesn’t worry about stuff.</p><p>“It is sad because he might be a once-in-a-lifetime horse that handles the dirt so well and I’m not able to travel him.

I’m going to send him to Conghua and he can have a bit of a break.
