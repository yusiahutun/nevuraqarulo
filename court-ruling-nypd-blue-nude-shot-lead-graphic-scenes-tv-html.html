broadcast on television after a New York appeals court overturned a Federal Communications Commission ruling against ABC.</p><p>The TV network had been fined $1.2million by the FCC for showing a naked behind during a 2003 episode of NYPD Blue but this was nullified on Tuesday.<br></p><p>'Children and families are the real victims today. This ruling will only serve to embolden the networks to air even more graphic material,' said Tim Winter, president of The Parents Television Council, a group that supports strong broadcast-indecency rules.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/01/07/article-1345159-0CAE5912000005DC-736_468x318.jpg height=318 width=468 alt="Dismissed: A New York appeals court overturned a $1.2million fine imposed on ABC by the FCC for showing a naked bottom on a 2003 episode of NYPD Blue" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Dismissed: A New York appeals court overturned a $1.2million fine imposed on ABC by the FCC for showing a naked bottom on a 2003 episode of NYPD Blue<br></p><p>'In this instance, ABC intentionally chose to air a scripted visual depiction of a fully naked woman before 10 p.m. There was absolutely nothing fleeting or accidental about it,' Mr Winter said in a statement.<br></p><p>'The inclusion of the lengthy and ogling scene was intended to pander and titillate. This was a clear breach of the decency law. And now, nearly eight years after the episode aired, ABC is told it doesn't have to abide by the law.'</p><p>The FCC had asserted that the network violated broadcast indecency standards when actress Charlotte Ross' rear end was shown on the hit crime drama.</p><p>The US Second Circuit Court of Appeals in New York threw out the 2008 ruling, citing FCC's own statement that 'nudity itself is not per se indecent'.<br></p><p>The Manhattan court decided on Tuesday to quash the $27,500 penalty against ABC and 45 of its affiliate stations whose combined fines came to over a million dollars.</p><p>The same court had called the FCC's enforcement of its indecency rules as 'unconstitutionally vague and chilling' in July last year.</p><p>This statement came on the back of Fox being cited for swear words aired between Cher and Nicole Richie that were not bleeped out in time during the 2006 Billboard Music Awards.</p><p>The FCC decided six years ago that TV stations could be fined for indecency violations when obscenities were aired during a live broadcast.</p><p>But the appeals court said its latest finding was consistent with its decision last year that TV stations can no longer be fined for fleeting, unscripted profanities uttered during live broadcasts.</p><p>The latest ruling in favour of ABC said: 'Although this case involved scripted nudity, the case turns on an application of the same content-based indecency text that Fox found vague.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/01/07/article-1345159-0CAE5AAA000005DC-428_233x423.jpg height=423 width=233 alt="Rear view: Actress Charlotte Ross' character disrobed as she prepared to get into the shower in the controversial episode" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Rear view: Actress Charlotte Ross' character disrobed as she prepared to get into the shower in the controversial episode<br></p><p>Lawrence Meyers, editor of Inside the TV Writer's Room said: 'Because networks know that they wont be fined [for showing a naked behind on screen], they know that it is another tool in the arsenal to engage viewers.</p><p>He said the the ruling , 'gives television producers and networks more freedom to do it if they wish'.</p><p>'Because network ratings are in severe decline and have been for a number of years, they may try to pull out all the stops and say, "Let's throw in as much nudity and swear words as we can out there", instead of focusing on playing great content, which they have not been doing'.</p><p>In the NYPD Blue episode, actress Charlotte Ross, playing character Connie McDowell, disrobes as she prepares to shower after she had recently moved in with Andy Sipowicz (Dennis Franz), another character on the show.<br></p><p>After her buttocks and the side of one of her breasts are briefly shown, the camera pans down and reveals her nude buttocks while she faces the shower.</p><p>Then Sipowicz's young son enters the bathroom and sees McDowell naked from the front, though the son blocks the audience's view of McDowell's nudity, according to a description of the scene in the court record.<br></p><p>Each character reacts with embarrassment. The child apologises, and McDowell, covering her private areas, responds, 'It's OK. No problem.'</p><p>The court said ABC stated the scene was included to portray the awkwardness between a child and his parent's new romantic partner and their difficulties in adjusting to life together.</p><p>NYPD Blue co-creator Steven Boncho said that he does not expect nudity to become a regular occurrence on network television.</p><p>'It's not just a question of, "Oh maybe they'll program where you're going to see a little t*** and a**"', said Mr Bochco. 'That's not the issue. The issue is, generally speaking, having a broader palette to tell your stories'.</p><p>He added: 'I thought NYPD Blue would sort of usher in a somewhat more relaxed approach to adult fare on broadcast TV and instead, it carved out a niche for itself... it never really spilled over into broadcast TV programming in general.</p><p>'Part of it was the [period's] political climate, and a lot of it was due to the fact that it's an advertising-driven medium.'</p><p>Mr Boncho said that he hoped the ruling would convince programme makers to push the boundaries and try edgier story lines.</p><p>But he conceded that 'broadcast TV is not in the business of controversy'.</p><p>Mr Meyers said it may lead to a slippery slope of more contentious scenes on TV.</p><p>'Not just nudity, but will it be showing sexual pleasure or showing a little more violent content than you might have seen before.</p><p>'Instead of cutting away when a dagger is plunged into somebody's neck, do we see a little bit of blood spurting out first? Every little push forward, you might call it a microcalibration', he added.</p><p>The FCC had imposed its most severe fine after receiving numerous complaints following the broadcast.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWJ%2BdICUamxyZ3OkwrPAjKuspaGenHqPpa99ZHukpZp6r8HDnmSsoJ%2Bpeq2xwJ1koKqRpbWqr4ysmp6mlah6laKNoaumpA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jackie-ibanez-wiki-bio-husband-net-worth-spouse-family-parents.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jackie Ibanez Wiki Bio, Husband, Net Worth, Spouse, Family, Parents</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bay-springs-man-seriously-injured-in-hebron-atv-crash.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Bay Springs man seriously injured in Hebron ATV crash | Free News</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./french-montanas-solid-wallet-explains-why-he-aint-worried-bout-nothin.html>French Montanas solid wallet explains why he Aint Worried Bout Nothin Tue 5 July 2022</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-jackson-new-album-songs-for-mother-daughters.html>Alan Jackson's New Album Features Songs for His Late Mother, More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-f1cf0f18-55b5-552e-a3b7-517c726ba35c-html.html>Eagles C Jason Kelce retires after 13 seasons | National</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65b82c73268e3ecb698b458b-html.html>Resultados Progol 2213: premios y quiniela ganadora del fin de semana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-cbd-products.html>What Is It, Is It Legal, And Will It Get You High?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib.
