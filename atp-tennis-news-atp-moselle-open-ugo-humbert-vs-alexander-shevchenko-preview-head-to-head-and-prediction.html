Now, the tournament will see Ugo Humbert facing Alexander Shevchenko.

Before fans see the top talent of tennis battle it out in Turin, they will see one ultimate player crowned as champion in France.</span></p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><strong><span>Ugo Humbert vs Alexander Shevchenko: Preview</span></strong></h2><p><span>Humbert is a 25-year-old French player who is steadily rising up the ATP ladder. He has participated in all Slams this year and some of the major Masters this year. He attained his best records in both. His best in Slams was a Round 3 appearance in the </span><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9><span>Australian Open</span></a><span>. He reached the quarterfinal in the&nbsp;</span><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9><span>Shanghai Masters</span></a><span>, his best result so far. He also won two clay Challenger tournaments this year in May.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Coming into the final of the Moselle Open, Humbert defeated&nbsp;</span><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9><span>Dominic Thiem</span></a><span>&nbsp;in round 2 and&nbsp;</span><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9><span>Fabio Fognini</span></a><span>&nbsp;in the semifinal. He has only dropped one set, which he fought hard to win. Now, he awaits one of his biggest challenges in the tournament.</span></p><p><span>On the other side, Shevchenko has also moved up the rankings by a huge margin this season. He achieved a career-high of 63 in October. Despite climbing higher, Shevchenko has not managed to win any ATP tournaments this year. However, he has won two challenger tournaments in Bratislava and Madrid. He performed great in the Swiss Indoors, where he beat </span><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9><span>Stan Wawrinka</span></a><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9><span>Taylor Fritz</span></a><span>&nbsp;after coming up from the qualifiers.</span></p><p><span>In the Moselle Open, he has only dropped one set till the final. He will now face Humbert as his ultimate battle, hoping to win his first ATP 250 tournament.</span></p><a href=# class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b transparent-card"><img id="img-tag-atp-tennis-news-they-are-even-more-famous-than-jannik-sinner-addresses-his-flamboyant-fan-groups-fame-in-a-cheeky-revelation-at-atp-finals?utm_campaign=internal_links&utm_medium=dive_deeper&utm_source=website-embed-image" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/2021-10-29T213125Z_1126451406_UP1EHAT1NSC7M_RTRMADP_3_TENNIS-VIENNA-447x315.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b card-content">‘They Are Even More Famous Than..’- Jannik Sinner Addresses His Flamboyant Fan-Group’s Fame in a Cheeky Revelation at ATP Finals</p></a><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><strong><span>Humbert vs Shevchenko: Head-to-Head</span></strong></h2><p><span>Humbert and Shevchenko have never faced each other before. The two finalists will play against each other for the first time in Metz. Their bout will be a surprise for the audience in France, who are more likely to support the local player. Both players will exchange rallies to make sure that they are the ones who will have a better chance of being the victor.</span></p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><strong><span>Prediction: Humbert to take the championship&nbsp;</span></strong></h2><p><span>The bout between both players will show us some great points. Shevchenko has moved up the ATP ladder, but his run in the Moselle Open will end with him being the runner-up of the tournament. Humbert, who has jumped miles in his improvement, has a much better chance of taking the trophy home. What are your opinions on who will win the championship?
