Change is never easy when it comes to <a href=# id=auto-tag_astrology data-tag=astrology>astrology</a>, but once you realize <a href=#>how Neptune retrograde will affect your zodiac sign</a>, you may feel a lot more relaxed about the concept. Although this retrograde is not without its challenges, it ultimately brings you a form of closure and clarity you didn’t realize you needed.</p><p>Neptune is just as elusive as it is fascinating. Just when you think you’ve grasped the concept of Neptune and what it stands for, the meaning evades you all over again. That’s because Neptune is <a href=#>the planet of dreams</a>, fantasies, illusions, and empathy. It’s the planet responsible for your vivid imagination and your ability to relate to others. It’s the planet that dissolves the boundaries that separates us from universal love. However, its nebulous quality also makes it one of the most misunderstood and overly romanticized plants of all, as Neptune can be just as deceptive as it is illuminating. If Neptune is involved in the equation, know that not everything is as it seems.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/askawitch_question3.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/newmoonintauruszodiac.gif?w=960&h=540&crop=1"><p>However, before you start jumping to conclusions, let me remind you that <a href=#>Neptune is already retrograde</a> nearly half of the time.
