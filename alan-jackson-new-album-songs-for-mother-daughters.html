Two of the new songs were written for his daughters, while he wrote a third to honor his mother after her death in 2017.</p><p>The country music icon announced on Friday (April 2) that he will release a massive new album titled&nbsp;Where Have You Gone&nbsp;on May 14, 2021.</p><p>The 21-song new project features "You'll Always Be My Baby" and "I Do," which Jackson wrote for his daughters' weddings.</p><p>"The first I wrote for Mattie's wedding, the summer of 2017," Jackson says in a press release. "But it was so hard to do, I told 'em, 'I wrote this for&nbsp;all&nbsp;of you. I'm not writing another!' The second just came out one day."</p><p>There's also a song inspired by Jackson's mother titled "Where Her Heart Has Always Been," which he wrote for her funeral.&nbsp; Mrs. Ruth Musick "Mama Ruth" Jackson died at her home in Georgia on Jan. 7, 2017, at the age of 86.</p><p>Jackson's studio version of "Where Her Heart Has Always Been" features an old recording of her reading from the Bible. One of the singer-songwriter's four sisters found the recording after the initial mix of the song was complete, and it was added on to finish the track.</p><p>"That was sweet. Towards the last few years, she had a scratchy voice," Jackson says. "But she was just such a sweet woman, a sweet, sweet lady, so we had to have that on here."</p><p>Jackson continues to proudly bear the standard of a devout country traditionalist on Where Have You Gone, whose <a href=#>title song</a> openly laments the passing of classic country music from the radio airwaves. He enlisted longtime producer&nbsp;Keith Stegall for the new project, which he <a href=#>says</a> represents "a little harder country than even I’ve done in the past."</p><p>“And it’s funny, I was driving and listening to the final mixes Keith sent me, and I started to tear up," Jackson shares. "I was surprised to get so overly emotional, but I just&nbsp;<i>love</i>&nbsp;this kind of music."</p><p>Jackson teased fans with <a href=#>three new tracks</a> on Friday.&nbsp;"Where Have You Gone" is a mournful, steel-soaked ballad, while "Way Down in My Whiskey" is a classic country lost-love drinking song and "Things That Matter" is a thoughtful, acoustic-based message song.</p><p>Fans had already heard the album's closing track, "<a href=#>The Older I Get</a>," which Jackson released in 2017.</p><p>Where Have You Gone&nbsp;is Jackson's first new album since&nbsp;Angels & Alcohol in 2015. The album is currently&nbsp;<a href=#>available for pre-order</a>.</p><p><strong>See Alan Jackson Through the Years: Country as All Get Out!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmmqSRo3qrrcKkqqimXaOyuHnApZmupV2ovK%2Bz0madqKpdory1tMSrZJ2ZpZy1tbHRrGY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./article-f1cf0f18-55b5-552e-a3b7-517c726ba35c-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Eagles C Jason Kelce retires after 13 seasons | National</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./french-montanas-solid-wallet-explains-why-he-aint-worried-bout-nothin.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>French Montanas solid wallet explains why he Aint Worried Bout Nothin Tue 5 July 2022</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./french-montanas-solid-wallet-explains-why-he-aint-worried-bout-nothin.html>French Montanas solid wallet explains why he Aint Worried Bout Nothin Tue 5 July 2022</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-jackson-new-album-songs-for-mother-daughters.html>Alan Jackson's New Album Features Songs for His Late Mother, More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-f1cf0f18-55b5-552e-a3b7-517c726ba35c-html.html>Eagles C Jason Kelce retires after 13 seasons | National</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65b82c73268e3ecb698b458b-html.html>Resultados Progol 2213: premios y quiniela ganadora del fin de semana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-cbd-products.html>What Is It, Is It Legal, And Will It Get You High?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib.
