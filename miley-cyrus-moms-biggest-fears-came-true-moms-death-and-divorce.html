It was during a difficult time and started to unravel at the height of the Covid pandemic when Miley Cyrus’ parents separated before filing for divorce.</strong></p><p>Tish appeared alongside her eldest daughter Brandi on the most recent episode of the Call Her Daddy podcast. She <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">spoke</a> candidly about her life and subsequent divorce from her husband of more than 30 years, Billy Ray Cyrus, 62. The <a href=#>celebrity couple</a> share five children together: Brandi, 36, Trace, 34, Miley, 30, Braison, 29, and Noah 24. Billy also has a son named Christopher, 31, from a previous relationship. Tish says a death in her family and divorce caused her mental health to nosedive.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-1097683076-683x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-miley-cyrus-parents-filed-for-divorce-after-tish-s-mom-died>Miley Cyrus’ parents filed for divorce after Tish’s mom died</h2><p><a href=#>Miley Cyrus’</a> mom Tish explained both of her worst fears came true in 2020 when she split from Billy and her mom passed away. Tish married the Achy Breaky Heart singer in 1993, and they had been on and off over the years, with two brief splits. However, they would reconcile each time, but in this instance, Tish says she knew it was the last time.</p><p>Although they separated in 2020, they didn’t file for divorce for two years.</p><p>She explained: “It was so crazy because, honestly, my two biggest fears in life were always being alone and my mom passing away.</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>George Clooney was Hollywood’s ‘heartthrob’ but wife Amal turned him down three times</a></p><p>“I was like, ‘I just don’t know if I’ll survive when my mom dies.’ Like, honestly. And I had, like, one month of a, honestly, complete psychological breakdown.</p><p>“It was the worst thing — like, honestly. It was not good.”</p><p>She called celebrity psychiatrist Daniel Amen&nbsp;and asked him to “please put me in a mental hospital,” but he didn’t think “that’s the best thing for either of us.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-they-lived-in-separate-states>They lived in separate states</h2><p>Miley Cyrus’ parents lived in separate states before their divorce. Billy Ray was living in Tennessee during the pandemic while Tish, 56, stayed in California, where the <a href=#>music</a> star lives.</p><p>The <a href=#>celebrity</a> continued: “I could not eat. I could not sleep, I could not stop crying. I literally weighed, like, 130 [pounds],” she told host Alex Cooper.</p><p>Tish went on: “I don’t have my mom, and then I don’t have my husband that’s been my husband for 30 years. Like, holy crap, I’m scared.”</p><p>Tish said she found her solitude “hugely transformative” but added: “[Our marriage] had not been in a good place for a long time, and I think I did stay so long out of fear — literal fear — of being alone.”</p><p>She married her new man, <a href=#>TV</a> actor Dominic Purcell, last year. Whereas, Billy found new love in fellow musician Firerose, and they also tied the knot in October.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-tish-speaks-out-over-claims-hannah-montana-destroyed-them>Tish speaks out over claims Hannah Montana ‘destroyed’ them</h2><p>Elsewhere on the podcast, Tish reacted to a 2011 claim by Billy Ray, who said the <a href=#>Disney</a> Channel show “destroyed” their family unit.</p><p>He <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> GQ: “Oh, it’s huge – it destroyed my family. I’ll tell you right now – the damn show destroyed my family. And I sit there and go, ‘Yeah, you know what? Some gave all.’ It is my motto, and guess what? I have to eat that one.”</p><p>Billy continued: “I some-gave-all’d it all right. I some-gave-all’d it while everybody else was going to the bank. It’s all sad.”</p><p>He was then asked if he wished the show, which even got a feature-length <a href=#>movie</a>, had never happened. He responded: “I hate to say it, but yes, I do. Yeah. I’d take it back in a second. For my family to be here and just be everybody okay, safe and sound and happy and normal, would have been fantastic. Heck, yeah. I’d erase it all in a second if I could.”</p><p>Tish didn’t agree about the series that launched her daughter’s <a href=#>Hollywood</a> career and said: “Absolutely not. I just think he was having a moment.”</p><p>Brandi then put in her two cents and said: &nbsp;“The family’s not destroyed, first of all. We’re doing great.”</p><p><strong>If you are affected by any issues raised in the article or would like someone to speak to, please call the Samaritans for free on 116 123.
