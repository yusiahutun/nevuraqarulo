As some might say, unusual times call for bold fashion, and our uncertain times have us craving the comfort of familiarity. Giambattista Valli, Moschino, Rochas, Batsheva, Comme des Garçons, Richard Quinn, and many more designers showcased the bow for the upcoming season, all in different iterations. And emerging brands have been welcoming the bow with open arms too.</p><img alt="bows in fashion" title="bows in fashion" width=1800 height=1798 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-bows-runway-1638390893.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Clockwise from left: Comme des Garçons, Giambattista Valli, Richard Quinn, Comme des Garçons, Giambattista Valli, Moschino, all spring 2022.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“​​Ribbons and bows make me think of the main characters from books and movies that I always loved growing up,” Shelly Horst, the designer behind the Philadelphia-based accessories brand <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://roomshopvintage.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Room Shop" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Room Shop</u></a>, explains. The label recently launched supersized ribbons that tie into bows, and Horst has been styling them ever so dramatically in low ponytails and buns. “In stories like Anne of Green Gables or Little House on the Prairie, a hair ribbon was always a very special and expensive accessory, often made of the finest silk and in the most beautiful colors. I love how a bow can be used to pull an outfit together.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Likewise, Shanghai-based womenswear label <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.shushutongstudio.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Shushu/Tong class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Shushu/Tong</u></a> has made the bow a major part of its brand identity, with bow-embellished dresses, bow bandeau tops that stand on their own, and even strapless dresses with enormous bows in the back. Designers Liushu Lei and Yutong Jiang take inspiration “from Japanese animation,” Lei says, adding, “The bow is powerful.” Powerhouse brands like Miu Miu and Chanel place bows over and over again on shoes, in hair accessories, through jewelry, and on glitzy dresses, making it modern to wear the bow.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The bow itself dates all the way back to ancient times. A set of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/322900 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sumerian hair ribbons made of gold" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Sumerian hair ribbons made of gold</u></a> from 2600 to 2500 BC can be found at The Metropolitan Museum of Art. But “bows as we think of them today came around the Middle Ages with the introduction of the ribbon, made possible with the invention of the horizontal loom,” Sarah Collins, a professor of fashion at Savannah College of Art and Design, explains.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the 16th and 17th centuries, the bow as we’re more familiar with it, became popular for all genders, worn in the hair. “Wearing a bow tied to a long lock of hair was called a ‘love lock’; the lock of hair was usually grown out longer than the remainder of the hair, then braided and laid upon the chest, and tied with a bow,” Collins adds. The bow in turn represented romance, since it was close to the heart.</p><img alt=hepburn title=hepburn width=2882 height=3572 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/katharine-hepburn-gettyimages-3171575-1638391077.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">John Kobal Foundation</span><p>Hepburn in a bow.</p><img alt="bows in fashion" title="bows in fashion" width=3377 height=3926 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/marlene-dietrich-gettyimages-3169074-1638391121.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">William Walling</span><p>Dietrich in a bow.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But even today, the bow has a major presence on all genders. Take, for example, the bow tie, which most people accredit to Pierre Lorillard. In 1886, he designed the modern tuxedo and bow as we know it, with a black bow tie. Since then, men have been wearing the style in a multitude of iterations. The bow tie itself even crossed over to womenswear for a brief moment in the 1920s and 1930s, courtesy of Katharine Hepburn and Marlene Dietrich. When the famed designer Elsa Schiaparelli launched her knitwear collection in 1927, she celebrated the bow with a trompe l’oeil re-creation of it knitted into the neckline of a sweater.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Likewise, the bow was used as a hair accessory among the French aristocracy of the 18th century. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://time.com/5642621/jojo-bows-history/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rumor has it" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Rumor has it</a>, the Marquise de Fontange, a mistress of Louis XIV, started the trend. She reportedly lost her hat while riding a horse. Since it was considered risqué to have loose hair, she pulled a ribbon off her dress to tie up her locks. From there, the trend took off. Marie Antoinette’s hairdresser, for example, allegedly spent roughly 20,000 francs on her hair ribbons.</p><img alt="chanel bows" title="chanel bows" width=2120 height=3185 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/chanel-1995-gettyimages-520571988-1638391170.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Victor VIRGILE</span><p>Chanel Autumn 1995 runway.</p><img alt="miu miu" title="miu miu" width=2837 height=4256 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/miumiu-fw21-gettyimages-1210286441.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Victor VIRGILE</span><p>An iconic Miu Miu bow.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">With the cottagecore subculture taking over TikTok last year and royalcore and lovecore aesthetics thriving today, it’s no wonder designers are taking inspiration from the Marie Antoinette look. Take, for instance, Instagram sensation <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/selkie/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Selkie class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Selkie</a>, which recently launched its <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://selkiecollection.com/collections/petit-trianon/products/the-parfait-poet-marie-dress data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Petit Trianon" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Petit Trianon</u></a> collection replete with bows everywhere, including on the arms of the garments and at the centers of low-plunging necklines, inspired by Antoinette’s billowing gowns.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“A notable part of bow history was when women would place a bow at the top of the bodice, which had a low décolletage,” Collins adds. “This was called a parfait contenement, or ‘the perfect contentment.’ The bow served no functional purpose on the outfit and, therefore, was used as a status symbol.” We can see a similar homage to the bow in <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.hillhousehome.com/collections/waverly/products/the-waverly-pillow-case-set?variant=12470576516" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Hill House Home" data-vars-ga-product-id=61699f48-11a6-481e-a7d1-29be047f39c3 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href="https://www.hillhousehome.com/collections/waverly/products/the-waverly-pillow-case-set?variant=12470576516" data-product-url="https://www.hillhousehome.com/collections/waverly/products/the-waverly-pillow-case-set?variant=12470576516" data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hillhousehome.com%2Fcollections%2Fwaverly%2Fproducts%2Fthe-waverly-pillow-case-set%3Fvariant%3D12470576516" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=d3541b44-1086-4b73-a023-3f130bb72a27 class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Hill House Home</a>’s nap dresses, which became such a fixture of 2020 that the brand could barely keep up with the demand. Each dress from the label has a soft, homey silhouette inspired by napping and comfort, and many of them are also adorned with a little bow, which ties behind the shoulders. Founder Nell Diamond also dons large bows in her dramatic long hair, in honor of her “Victorian ghost vibe,” as she calls it.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">At the same time, bows have so much range that they’ve also been used as a mark of resistance. Bows were worn as ribbon cockades in the French Revolution, and on hats as a sign of defiance against Hitler during World War II. “French women would adorn their hats and later their turbans with ribbons and other scraps of fabric they scrounged in defiance of the German’s rules against extravagance,” Collins explains. And they’re common in schoolgirl uniforms around the world, from Asia and Russia to right here in the United States, where ribbons are worn in the hair and bows decorate the collar and embellish other parts of the outfit. The fact that bows can symbolize so many different things—from royalty to revolution to girlishness—is perhaps one of the biggest reasons that they feel so right in 2021.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Fast-forward to the 1960s and 1970s, when the bow became a symbol of women’s workplace empowerment in the form of the pussy bow top, which appeared on runways from Yves Saint Laurent to Halston. (Since then, it’s been re-created everywhere from Gucci to Balmain.) In the ’80s—an era that contemporary fashion has been mining lately—wearing a bold bow was a way to harness the intrinsic glamour of standing out from the crowd. In their own ways, both Madonna and Princess Diana (whose style is experiencing a fashion renaissance thanks in part to the release of the film Spencer) showcased the power of an ’80s bow.</p><img alt="diana at the races" title="Diana At The Races" width=673 height=1024 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/diana-princess-of-wales-attends-a-charity-greyhound-racing-news-photo-1638391305.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Princess Diana Archive</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Princess Diana wears a bow tie.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The bows of spring 2022 draw on all these references, but add elements of individualism. Look at Comme des Garçons’ massive sculpture-like structures covered in chunky bow prints (Rei Kawakubo essentially said the collection was about getting rid of the conventions of fashion). Or Richard Quinn’s neat and plump bows, which are placed atop otherworldly catsuits and tied under the chin from babushka-like scarves. These bows are about personal style, strength, and power. “To me, ribbons and bows represent femininity and innocence,” Horst adds. “I love that they are a whimsical and dreamy outfit-completer that is not necessarily meant for the male gaze.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">To me, wearing a bow as a woman in 2021 feels more like a statement of power than anything else. Instead of being about satisfying a rule like uniform guidelines or pulling one’s hair back to be more conventionally presentable, wearing a bow is firmly about dressing for oneself.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/b6abc375-c94a-4cdc-9891-fbdadaa6d1db_1526037769.jpg alt="Headshot of Kristen Bateman" title="Headshot of Kristen Bateman" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Kristen Bateman is a contributing editor at Harper’s Bazaar.
