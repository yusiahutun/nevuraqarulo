She noted via her Instagram Story that the little one was born on October 23 at 2:39 a.m. and weighed 7 lbs. 9 ounces and was 20 inches long.</p><p>Madelyn joined <a href=#>Anna and Josh’s six other children</a>: Mackenzie, 12, Michael, 10, Marcus, 8, Meredith, 6, Mason, 4, and Maryella, 23 months.</p><p>The baby’s arrival came amid <a href=#>Josh’s ongoing child pornography case</a>. Josh, who is the eldest child of Michelle and Jim Bob, was arrested in April, just weeks after he and Anna announced they were expecting baby No. 7.</p><p>“It’s a GIRL!!!!!” <a href=#>Anna wrote via Instagram at the time</a>. “We are overjoyed to announce baby seven is on the way and we can’t wait to hold her in our arms this fall!”</p><p>Later that month, <a href=#>Josh was taken into custody</a> at the Washington County jail in Arkansas and charged with receiving and possessing child pornography. He entered <a href=#>a not guilty plea</a> and was set to begin his trial in July.</p><p>The 19 Kids and Counting alum filed a motion in June to extend the trial date to 2022, <a href=#>but a judge only granted a four-month extension</a>. The trial is now set for November.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Michelle-and-Jim-Bob-Duggar-Speak-Out-After-Josh-Duggar-and-Wife-Anna-Welcome-Their-7th-Child-Amid-Controversy2.jpg><p>TLC canceled the <a href=#>Duggar family’s spinoff series</a>, Counting On, amid the controversy, <a href=#>announcing the news in June</a>.</p><p>While many of his siblings starred on Counting On, Josh and Anna left the network in 2015 after multiple girls came forward and <a href=#>accused him of molesting them</a> when he was 14.</p><p>“Twelve years ago, as a young teenager, I acted inexcusably for which I am extremely sorry and deeply regret. I hurt others, including my family and close friends,” Josh said in a statement via Facebook at the time. “We spoke with the authorities where I confessed my wrongdoing, and my parents arranged for me and those affected by my actions to receive counseling. I understood that if I continued down this wrong road that I would end up ruining my life.”</p><p>Josh was later <a href=#>involved in a cheating scandal</a>, apologizing for being “the biggest hypocrite ever” before completing a six-month stint in rehab in March 2016.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Amid his ongoing child pornography case, <a href=#>Anna has stood by Josh’s side appearing at his September hearing</a> where a judge denied four of Josh’s five motions in the case. The former TLC personality filed a motion to suppress the photographs taken of his hands and feet at the time of his arrest and a motion to dismiss the case completely, both of which were denied.</p><p>Two other motions — one to suppress the statements Josh allegedly made to federal agents during the investigation and another one to dismiss the indictment because of who was in charge of Homeland Security at the time — were also denied by a judge at the time. But the fifth motion, which is tied to suppressing evidence, wasn’t ruled on.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGamoZOdsq24xGahoqVdl7yjecOunqCZomKwprjEm6marJVit7C%2Fx2abrp%2BXlr9urc2nmKxlZ6m1bq7Am7Bo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./northampton-town-fc-12-football-club-facts.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Northampton Town FC: 12 Football Club Facts</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./local-events.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Local Events | leader-call.com</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./french-montanas-solid-wallet-explains-why-he-aint-worried-bout-nothin.html>French Montanas solid wallet explains why he Aint Worried Bout Nothin Tue 5 July 2022</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-jackson-new-album-songs-for-mother-daughters.html>Alan Jackson's New Album Features Songs for His Late Mother, More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-f1cf0f18-55b5-552e-a3b7-517c726ba35c-html.html>Eagles C Jason Kelce retires after 13 seasons | National</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65b82c73268e3ecb698b458b-html.html>Resultados Progol 2213: premios y quiniela ganadora del fin de semana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-cbd-products.html>What Is It, Is It Legal, And Will It Get You High?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib.
