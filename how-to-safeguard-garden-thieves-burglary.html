Here are some simple measures you can take to protect your garden from theft:</p><li>Secure the boundaries of your property, particularly at the rear where it might be harder to see an intruder.</li><li>Fix a trellis at the top of a fence or grow a thorny climber. Both are good deterrents, as is a thick hedge.

Alternatively, cement or bolt them down.</li><li>Do your homework. Ensure your outdoor belongings are included on your home insurance and that your policy provides sufficient cover for their value.</li><li>Lock away high-value items, such as tools or your lawn mower, in a secure building that keeps them out of sight.</li><li>Beware repeat offenders. If you replace a stolen item, upgrade the security of where you store it. Thieves are known to return for the replacement.</li><img alt="best garden parasol" title="best garden parasol " width=2000 height=1500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/best-garden-parasols-1615979253.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-o6q7mr e6iqukd2">YinYang</span><span class="css-1xncx8o e6iqukd0">//</span><span class="css-o6q7mr e6iqukd1">Getty Images</span></p><h2 data-node-id=5 class="body-h3 css-14uq8j5 et3p2gv0">How to prevent dog theft</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Sales of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.countryliving.com/uk/wildlife/dog-breeds/a34941519/dog-breeds-positive-personalities/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=dogs class="body-link css-199th1 et3p2gv0">dogs</a> have rocketed in the past few months: on its website alone, The Kennel Club recently reported a 168% surge in searches for puppies. This, unfortunately, has inflated the price tags of our dogs and made them a target for thieves.

Most of this rise has been driven by the theft of high-value tractors, quad bikes and other farm vehicles.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Four categories are particularly picked over when it comes to farm thefts: agricultural vehicles (tractors, diggers and transporters, for example, but also GPS systems), quads and all-terrain vehicles or ATVs, Land Rover Defenders (entire vehicles and parts) and, perhaps most upsetting, livestock.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Sheep, it seems, are being stolen and slaughtered outside of regulated abattoirs before illegally entering the food chain. Not only is this a grave risk to human health but the effects are devastating for farmers who have spent years building up breeding lines and nurturing their flocks. And, while sheep rustling was a minor issue only 10 years ago, the market for illegal meat has rocketed and farmers are regularly finding their farms emptied of 50 to 100 lambs at a time or, even worse, discovering them killed on site. Unlike many crimes, which dropped during lockdown, sheep rustling actually spiked as gangs exploited the deserted roads and worries about food shortages.</p><img alt=sheep title=sheep width=1333 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/countryliving.cdnds.net/18/10/1520611570-flock.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-o6q7mr e6iqukd2">Cristian Barnett</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Far from being opportunistic local crimes, rural theft is big business and often the work of organised criminal gangs crossing county borders. PC Mark Atkinson, of North Yorkshire’s Rural Taskforce, sees his area “being hard hit by organised gangs coming into the region, predominantly from West Yorkshire, to steal quad bikes and horse trailers, which then have their identity changed and are sold on”. Tractors and other farm vehicles are also being stolen nationwide and then doctored to appear legitimately owned before being shipped out of the country.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="body-h3 css-14uq8j5 et3p2gv0">How to make a stand against rural crime</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Police, farmers and smallholders, however, are fighting back. As every farm is unique in both size and location, a nuanced approach to crime prevention is needed. A winning combination of community involvement, technology and security measures seems to be giving rural criminals a run for their money. On a regional level, farmers are being encouraged to engage with their local police rural crime officers, report suspicious sightings and incidents, join schemes such as <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.ourwatch.org.uk/scheme/9382/farm-watch data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Farm Watch" class="body-link css-199th1 et3p2gv0">Farm Watch</a> or <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cheshire.police.uk/advice/advice-and-information/wsi/watch-schemes-initiatives/rw/rural-watch/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rural Watch" class="body-link css-199th1 et3p2gv0">Rural Watch</a>, and create social media groups with other farmers to share news.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">PC Atkinson has seen, first hand, the effectiveness of North Yorkshire’s Rural Taskforce, which was set up five years ago to tackle rural and wildlife crime. “Great strides have been made in that time to engage with our local communities, assisting with crime prevention advice and targeted patrols in areas.” Police and existing rural watches are also sharing information on WhatsApp groups. “By doing this together, we can throw a larger net over an area,” he continues, “with more eyes and ears looking out for suspect vehicles and behaviour.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Technology also has its part to play. “You can’t take what you can’t start,” explains rural affairs specialist Rebecca Davidson, and so immobilisers and trackers are absolute musts, while the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://cesarscheme.org/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="CESAR registration scheme" class="body-link css-199th1 et3p2gv0">CESAR registration scheme</a> is helping to aid the recovery of stolen agricultural equipment.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">CCTV linked to a mobile phone can provide farmers with extra surveillance, while ‘geo-fencing’ apps alert owners if their kit goes out of a designated area. Sheep thieves are also being thwarted by a smart new invention called TecTracer, a special paint that contains a digital code linking livestock to a particular farm. And, of course, there’s no substitute for good old-fashioned physical security.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Anti-theft devices such as steering locks and ram locks on vehicles deter thieves, while basic measures such as fitting locks to workshops and barns, using security gates and lighting and not leaving kit in sight of a public highway will all help. It’s frustrating that they’re necessary, but by taking these steps and working together, we might just prevent a cider-fuelled chancer taking someone else’s combine for a spin.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0"><strong>Like this article? <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://hearst.emsecure.net/optiext/cr.aspx?ID=zsATrj4qAwL7PXfHOfbti0xjie5wOfecvOt8e1A3WvL5x0TsMrTgu8waUpN%2BcCNsV3wq_zCaFTleze" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sign up to our newsletter " class="body-link css-199th1 et3p2gv0">Sign up to our newsletter </a>to get more articles like this delivered straight to your inbox. </strong><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://hearst.emsecure.net/optiext/cr.aspx?ID=zsATrj4qAwL7PXfHOfbti0xjie5wOfecvOt8e1A3WvL5x0TsMrTgu8waUpN%2BcCNsV3wq_zCaFTleze" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="SIGN UP" rel=nofollow data-href="https://hearst.emsecure.net/optiext/cr.aspx?ID=zsATrj4qAwL7PXfHOfbti0xjie5wOfecvOt8e1A3WvL5x0TsMrTgu8waUpN%2BcCNsV3wq_zCaFTleze" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink class="body-btn-link css-1x1g445 et3p2gv0">SIGN UP</a></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0"><strong>Looking for some positivity?
