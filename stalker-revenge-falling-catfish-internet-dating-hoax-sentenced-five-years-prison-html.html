unwittingly become part of an Internet dating scam similar to the MTV show ‘Catfish’.</span></p><p><span>Brian Hile, 29, was caught a mile from the home of Tiffany Watkins in San Diego, California with a to-do list which included buying a knife and chloroform.</span></p><p><span>Her image had been used by a gay man in South Africa who had fooled him into thinking he was a woman - and began a two-year online relationship with him.</span></p><img id=i-a70b0e55 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/12/23/article-2528570-1A46401D00000578-109_634x434.jpg height=434

class=imageCaption>The would-be killer: Brian Hile was arrested before being able to carry out his evil revenge plot</p><p><span>When Hile discovered he had been fooled he decided to lash out at Miss Watkins, even though she had not played any part in the scam.</span></p><p><span>The erotic images of her that the scammer had used had only ended up in the public domain when they were stolen from an online account of hers when she was younger.</span></p><p><span>Hile, who is unemployed, was jailed for five years in what the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# style=font-weight:700>FBI</a> have called a ‘cautionary tale about online romance and revenge’.</span></p><p><span>It also sounds like an episode of ‘Catfish’, in which innocent daters are told how they have been manipulated by people who are not who they claim to be.</span></p><p><span>Often the scammers use images of attractive women they have found on the Internet to fool their targets to satisfy their twisted desires for control.</span></p><p><span>Hile had been living with his 86-year-old grandmother Virginia Dewitte in her mobile home in Fremont, Michigan, when he was fooled by unnamed man in South Africa.</span></p><p><span>Hile would speak to ‘her’ on the phone regularly sent her pictures of his private parts, though they never met in person or spoke via video on Skype.</span></p><p><span>Prosecutors said that when he found out his ‘lover’ was a gay man, he shouted out: ‘Grandma, it’s a gay! I hate gay guys’.</span></p><img id=i-aa260e7c src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/12/23/article-2528570-1A464F4C00000578-539_634x739.jpg height=739 width=634 alt="Fooled: A gay man used pictures of this model to 'catfish' Mr Hine" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Fooled: A gay man used pictures of this model to 'catfish' Mr Hine</p><p><span>Dewitte told investigators that Hile ‘fell in love with the woman’ and was ‘obsessed with the failed Internet relationship and deception’.</span></p><p><span>Through Internet sleuthing he was able to find out that the pictures were actually of Miss Watkins -
