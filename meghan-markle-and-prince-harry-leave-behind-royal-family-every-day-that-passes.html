A royal expert now says the two are leaving the royal family behind with “every day that passes.”</strong></p><p>The Duchess of Sussex is paving the way towards a <a href=#>Hollywood</a> career after leaving the royal family behind. <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> rose to the limelight thanks to her acting career. She was best known for her role in the legal drama Suits before joining the <a href=#>royals</a> in 2018. Some experts feel that Meghan and Harry <a href=#>“owe their fame to spilling the royal family’s secrets</a>.” But no amount of opinions is stopping the Sussexes from establishing themselves in California. Now an expert says that the 42-year-old mother of two will most likely never return to her in-law’s home country – England.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/10/GettyImages-1008102002-1024x739.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meghan-markle-never-really-embraced-the-royal-way-of-life>Meghan Markle never really embraced the royal way of life</h2><p>Speaking to Fox News, author Andrew Morton, who wrote Diana: Her True Story, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a> Meghan wants to stay in California. Morton also weighed in on her brief life as a royal saying she “never really embraced the rules and rituals of the royal family.”</p><p>He added, “Meghan is making her own life on the West Coast.” He further indicates how she and <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> have moved on with their whole beef with The Firm, saying, “The royal family is very much in the rearview mirror of her life. She’s moved on.”</p><p>He further points out how the Duchess of Sussex “didn’t understand that she had to curtsy to [the late Queen Elizabeth] in private.” He also points out how Meghan and <a href=#>Kate Middleton</a> could never establish a meaningful relationship with each other, despite being the two royal daughters-in-law.</p><p>“It’s no secret that&nbsp;there’s not much love lost between Kate [Middleton] and Meghan, and [the latter] is making her own life on the West Coast.” The strife between <a href=#>Meghan and Kate</a> was highly publicized after Prince Harry’s Spare came out in early 2023. The book detailed several instances where the two locked horns with each other.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/10/GettyImages-1690615265-1024x850.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meghan-and-harry-are-established-in-california-now>Meghan and Harry are established in California now</h2><p>Morton further says that even Harry is quite at home in California now.</p><p>“I think [Prince Harry and Markle] got their own lives, and they’ve worked it out. And every day that passes, they’re more established in California.” The royal expert also pointed out how the couple has chosen the perfect place to live.</p><p>Noting that their home state is crawling with millionaires and even billionaires, the expert says.</p><p>“So if they want to&nbsp;raise money for their charities, they’ve picked… very fertile ground. Other royals will envy that they can go to dinner and raise millions of dollars for their charities. So that’s what they’ll do,” he said.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-duchess-old-confession-about-being-a-celebrity-resurfaces>Duchess’ old confession about being a ‘celebrity’ resurfaces</h2><p>In Angela Levin’s <a href=# rel=nofollow>book</a>, Harry: Conversations With The Prince, the author mentions Meghan’s celebrity confession in her now-deleted blog on The Tig.</p><p>The Duchess ran the lifestyle blog between 2014 and 2017 before shutting it down for good after her relationship with Harry took center stage in her life.</p><p>In one of her blogs, the now 42-year-old said, “My life shifts from refugee camps to red carpets. I choose them both because these worlds can, in fact, co-exist. And for me, they must.”</p><p>She further wrote: “I, in fact, have always had a foot in the world of entertainment as well as the world of public service.</p><p>“My life now is simply a more heightened version of the very reality in which I grew up. And, truth be told, it is the most beautiful gift I never knew I always had.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpoX2Z9cLnEoJ%2Bapl2irrO3y55kmqaUYr2ztc2cnGagkae%2FunnLnpivnV2Xsqm1zZ1kq6eplrlussCmoKWxXZrDpr7YZpuasV2ptaLAjKmYrKuVqHw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./apps-learning-history.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The 7 Best History Apps That Make Learning History Exciting</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./461799-mc-lytes-bio-net-worth-sexuality-partner-kids-family.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mc Lyte's bio: net worth, sexuality, partner, kids, and family</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./french-montanas-solid-wallet-explains-why-he-aint-worried-bout-nothin.html>French Montanas solid wallet explains why he Aint Worried Bout Nothin Tue 5 July 2022</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-jackson-new-album-songs-for-mother-daughters.html>Alan Jackson's New Album Features Songs for His Late Mother, More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-f1cf0f18-55b5-552e-a3b7-517c726ba35c-html.html>Eagles C Jason Kelce retires after 13 seasons | National</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65b82c73268e3ecb698b458b-html.html>Resultados Progol 2213: premios y quiniela ganadora del fin de semana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-cbd-products.html>What Is It, Is It Legal, And Will It Get You High?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib.
