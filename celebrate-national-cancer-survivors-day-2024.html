According to the most recent global estimates, one in five men and one in six women will develop cancer over the course of their lifetime. Currently, more than 18.1 million people are living with and beyond cancer in the U.S. today. And an estimated 53.5 million people have survived cancer within the past 5 years worldwide.&nbsp;</p><p>On Sunday, June 2, 2024, people around the world are joining together to acknowledge these cancer survivors, and to raise awareness of the challenges of cancer survivorship, as part of the 37th&nbsp;annual National Cancer Survivors Day®&nbsp;Celebration of Life.</p><p>National Cancer Survivors Day®&nbsp;is an annual worldwide Celebration of Life that is held on the first Sunday in June. Hundreds of cities across the U.S. and abroad will hold celebrations on this day to honor the cancer survivors in their community, to raise awareness of the ongoing challenges cancer survivors face, and – most importantly – to celebrate life.</p><p>“A ‘survivor’ is anyone living with a history of cancer – from the moment of diagnosis through the remainder of life,” according to the National Cancer Survivors Day Foundation, administrator for the celebration.</p><p>“Cancer survivorship isn’t about just being alive after cancer. It’s about living life as fully as possible,” says Foundation spokesperson, Laura Shipp. “National Cancer Survivors Day®&nbsp;gives all cancer survivors – and those who love them – an opportunity to come together to celebrate life and show the world that you can have a full, meaningful, beautiful life after a cancer diagnosis.</p><p>“NCSD is also a call to action. As many survivors will tell you, the effects of cancer don’t end when treatment does. Cancer survivors face ongoing, often long-lasting, hardships because of their disease, including potentially devastating financial setbacks. On National Cancer Survivors Day®, we want to raise awareness of the many challenges of cancer survivorship and call for further research, more resources, and increased public awareness to improve cancer survivors’ quality of life.”</p><p>The National Cancer Survivors Day Foundation is encouraging everyone – cancer survivors, caregivers, healthcare professionals, family members, and friends – to join the worldwide celebration. To find out how your community is celebrating, contact the National Cancer Survivors Day Foundation. You can also host a celebration of your own using the resources available through the National Cancer Survivors Day®&nbsp;website, <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ncsd.org</a></strong>.</p><p>Additionally, the Foundation is offering a way for everyone, whether attending a local Celebration of Life or celebrating in their own unique way, to connect with fellow cancer survivors and supporters around the world on Sunday, June 2. You can follow the celebration online by using the hashtag #NCSD2024 and following National Cancer Survivors Day®&nbsp;on Facebook (<strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook.com/CancerSurvivorsDay</a></strong>), Instagram (<strong><a href=#>@cancersurvivorsday</a></strong>), and Twitter/X (<strong><a href=#>@survivorsday</a></strong>).</p><p>The nonprofit National Cancer Survivors Day Foundation offers free guidance, education, networking resources, and assistance to hundreds of hospitals, support groups, and other cancer-related organizations that host official National Cancer Survivors Day®&nbsp;celebrations. The Foundation’s primary mission is to bring awareness to the issues of cancer survivorship in order to improve quality of life for cancer survivors.</p><p>As the number of cancer survivors continues to increase, it is becoming ever more important to address the unique needs of this growing population. In addition to facing a serious illness, cancer survivors must contend with rapidly rising medical costs; inadequate insurance coverage; difficulty finding or keeping employment; and ongoing physical, psychological, and financial struggles that persist even after treatment ends.</p><p>The National Cancer Survivors Day Foundation – along with NCSD 2024 national supporters Aveo Oncology, Convatec,&nbsp;Coping with Cancer, Deciphera, Erasca Foundation, Hologic, Ipsen, Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine, and Springworks Therapeutics – is encouraging people across the globe to stand with these survivors on National Cancer Survivors Day®&nbsp;and bring attention to these challenges of cancer survivorship.</p><p>“So much progress has been made in the fight against cancer since the very first National Cancer Survivors Day®&nbsp;was held in 1987,” says Shipp. “However, we need to make sure that cancer survivors aren’t forgotten once treatment ends. It’s important that we address the long-term effects of cancer because cancer survivors deserve the best possible quality of life after facing this life-threatening disease.”</p><p>Leading up to National Cancer Survivors Day®, the NCSD Foundation urges everyone to spread the message that cancer survivorship isn’t about just being alive after cancer. It’s about living life as fully as possible.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>The following is a suggested post for your social media pages:</strong></h3><p>Cancer survivorship isn’t about just being alive after cancer.
