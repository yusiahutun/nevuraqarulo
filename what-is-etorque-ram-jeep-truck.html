At the eleventh hour, we decided it wasn't the vehicle for us right now. However, during our test drive, I couldn't help but notice how smooth the powertrain was. It's an exceptionally smooth and effortless feeling.</p><p>That's because it featured Stellantis' eTorque mild hybrid technology. The Wagoneer blends classic Hemi V8 power with an electric boost that elevates the driving experience to a level comparable to premium vehicles.</p><p>We break down everything you need to know about eTorque and why you should look for a Jeep or RAM truck with mild hybrid technology.</p><h2 id=what-is-etorque>What Is eTorque?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2019-ram-1500-with-etorque.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>eTorque is the proprietary name for mild hybrid technology used in Jeep and RAM vehicles. A mild hybrid is a combustion-engine powered car <a href=#>with a small electric motor that also acts as an alternator and electricity generator</a>. Unlike a classic hybrid, though, a mild hybrid cannot travel solely on electricity alone. However, it does use electricity to boost vehicle performance, efficiency, and smoothness.</p><p>This mild hybrid system was developed by the former Fiat Chrysler Automobiles before the company rebranded itself as Stellantis in 2021. The company introduced eTorque on the 2019 Jeep Wrangler and 2019 RAM 1500, but its availability has been expanded to several models.</p><h2 id=how-does-etorque-work>How Does eTorque Work?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The eTorque system replaces an internal combustion engine's alternator with an electric motor generator and a small battery pack that controls a vehicle's auto stop-start function. Even if you're used to driving vehicles with auto stop-start, a vehicle like the Jeep Wagoneer with eTorque almost completely eliminates any indication that the engine is turning off and on.</p><p>The instant torque from the electric motor and battery enables quick acceleration off the line with no lag while waiting for the engine to restart. A battery pack mounted in the back behind the rear seats stores <a href=#>electricity recovered from regenerative braking</a>, it powers vehicle accessories and keeps the regular battery and electric motor generator battery charged.</p><p>Aside from the buttery smoothness eTorque bestows on Jeep or RAM vehicles, the mild hybrid system does offer several benefits to the automakers' vehicle lineups.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Stellantis says eTorque enhances low-speed performance and passing power, especially when towing, in its Jeeps and RAM trucks. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kelly Blue Book</a> adds that eTorque improves fuel efficiency by up to 20% while reducing tailpipe emissions.</p><h2 id=what-vehicles-use-etorque>What Vehicles Use eTorque?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2022-wagoneer.jpg><p>Several Jeep and RAM truck models currently utilize the eTorque mild hybrid system. The 2023 Jeep Wrangler gets an eTorque-assisted V6 as standard when opting for the eight-speed automatic transmission. The 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder Wrangler models used to offer eTorque, but Jeep discontinued it in 2021.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>All 2022 Wagoneers (not the Grand Wagoneer) with the 5.7-liter V8 come with eTorque. For 2023, only base-model Wagoneers get the eTorque and V8 powertrain after Stellantis developed a new turbocharged inline-six engine that replaced it.</p><p>For the 2023 model year, the RAM 1500's 3.6-liter V6 and 5.7-liter V8 feature eTorque as standard equipment.</p><h2 id=etorque-lets-you-sample-electrification-without-range-anxiety>eTorque Lets You Sample Electrification Without Range Anxiety</h2><p>As automakers continue their march toward a world of EVs, not everyone is ready to make the jump to driving on batteries alone. And that's okay; you don't have to be. The US has a long road ahead to build up the infrastructure needed to support a fully electric car market.</p><p>In the meantime, if you are interested in electrification but aren't ready to commit to a full EV and the range anxiety that can accompany that, mild hybrid systems like eTorque are a great alternative. eTorque not only enhances the performance and efficiency of Jeep and RAM vehicles; it for sure makes driving them that much better and is a great stepping stone to buying a hybrid, plug-in hybrid, or full EV.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0ecStpquppZp6s63MZqGenaBiwbPBwqRm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./travis-hunter.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What is Travis Hunter Age and Net Worth 2023?
