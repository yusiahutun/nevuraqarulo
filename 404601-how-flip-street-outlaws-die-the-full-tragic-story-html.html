Other than his parents' identity, there is not much known about their occupation or anything else.</p><p class=align-left>Flip attended Hinton Elementary and later graduated from Putnam City High School in Warr Acres, Oklahoma. One of the most exciting things about Flip is that he loved cars from a young age and even shared the same passion with Justin <i>Big Chief</i> Shearer. They have been friends since they were kids and used to ride bikes together to watch drag races.</p><h2>Flip’s early life and before television</h2><p class=align-left>After completing his high school <a href=#>education</a>, Flip started working as a storekeeper. However, he did not surrender his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">passion</a> for cars and developed a profound love for pro-mode ones. He was also interested in a career in drag racing.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7d408cdf089310d8.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Scott on Counting Cars?

Flip used his remuneration from the firm to fund his passion for cars, mods, and racing. This gave him ample opportunity to build his automobile that is referred to as <i>The El Camino</i>. The car is a 1980 Chevy rebuilt and modified using different parts.</p><p class=align-left>His good friend, Big Chief, often referred to the car as a ticking time bomb because of the different modifications it had undergone over the years. He believed that the vehicle would either blow up or stop moving. Contrary to his opinion, <i>The El Camino</i> proved to be a great automobile that won Flip a lot of races and titles.</p><h2>Street Outlaws</h2><p class=align-left>Tyler <i>Flip</i> Priddy joined <i>Street Outlaws</i> in its first season in 2013 with his childhood friends <a href=#>Justin Shearer</a>, known by fans as Big Chief, and Chris Day, known as Kamikaze. They were approached by the reality television show producers the same year because of their strong racing culture rampant in Oklahoma.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/15a2b6225ac6e847.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Izzy on Flip or Flop?

The show's premiere in 2013 catapulted most of Flip's friends to stardom and great success in the genre.</p><p class=align-left>The reality television show had numerous members struggling to make it to television and become regulars. This created massive competition for Flip, who had to prove himself in races and win most of them to achieve the top spot. Also, Flip got the upper hand in the reality television show since he was friends and personally knew most of the participants.</p><p class=align-left>Flip also had a unique personality that many people liked. He was a smack talker and often had a beer and cigarette in one hand. Indeed, he proved to be a significant part of <i>Street Outlaws</i> in the first season. Numerous people are not aware that Flip passed away even before the first season premiered on television.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/04d42698aa2ab3ae.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to uncle Mike on Desert Flippers?
