It's hell on earth, as you can imagine. Just got super aggressive and that's why I called immediately, because he's been physical before and I'm just not doing that," Shiver tells responding officers in the video.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/48/4by3/2023/08/15/489c91462c4544d69f63b4034c0dc9c6_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit image-block__media-credit">Facebook</span><p>"Woke up this morning, we have travel plans to leave, and he's insisting that I don't go," Shiver continues.</p><p>"Are you just wanting to leave, or is he supposed to be going with you?" a police officer asks.</p><p>"Yeah we're supposed to be going with our kids," Shiver replies.</p><p>"She's going to the Bahamas to see her boyfriend," her husband Robert, a former Auburn University football player, interjects.</p><p>"I don't personally recommend you going on vacation together," the officer advises.</p><p>"I agree with that," Robert says.</p><p>But Shiver disagrees, saying, "It's just an hour on the plane."
