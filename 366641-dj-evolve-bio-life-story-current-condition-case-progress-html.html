The incident left the young DJ injured and traumatized and is undergoing gradual recovery under strict care from medical personal.</p><p class=align-left>How did the DJ Evolve shooting happen? Kenyans were shocked by the happening of that morning, and with a video doing rounds online, many people were enraged. It is alleged that Embakasi East Member of Parliament, Babu Owino shot him on the neck twice.</p><p class=align-left>It is not clear the circumstances that resulted in the shooting, but it is said that the two were great acquaintances and were even spotted together whenever the MP visited the club. On that day, the DJ would frequent Babu Owino's table to get song requests and probably have a chat. However, the tables <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">suddenly </a>changed when the MP allegedly shot him twice in the neck. The incident is still not apparent and is currently in court.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/441583d73f83253a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Katerina singer on the spot for branding Rwandese singers Meddy, The Ben lazy</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Cassidy Hubbarth biography: husband, children, ethnicity, wedding</p><h3>DJ Evolve current condition</h3><p class=align-left>What is the current condition of the DJ? DJ Evolve has been undergoing treatment for gunshot wounds after the incident at B-Club in Nairobi in January. He has been recuperating at the Nairobi Hospital, whereby he spent a considerable amount while at the Intensive Care Unit.</p><p class=align-left>Although there were earlier reports that DJ Evolve had been released in mid-May, it turned out that he was moved to the general ward. It wasn't until June 18, 2020, that the DJ was released from the hospital and is currently under home care.</p><p class=align-left>Even though his health has massively improved, he has limited mobility and can do little by himself. Unfortunately, he can hardly move his fingers and is numb from the mid-torso down. Also, he can barely speak as he has a tube placed on his neck to clear and suction his airwave.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0bf4342c17f2a948.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How did Flip from Street Outlaws die?
