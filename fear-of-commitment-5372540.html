When you are with a partner who is unable or chooses not to move to the next developmental milestone, it can cause tremendous problems. Sometimes, this happens because you are with someone who is emotionally unavailable, or, other times, it's just not a match. Frequently, the problem is that you are with someone who has a fear of commitment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Commitment-phobic people are scared by milestone events in a relationship like moving in together,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>monogamy</a>, engagement, marriage, or having children. Sometimes, they're able to have a long-term relationship, but when those commitments come up, they freak out.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-signs-your-partner-is-scared-of-commitment></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Signs Your Partner Is Scared of Commitment</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It's hard to know if it is fear of commitment — or if the two of you are just not a match. Fear of commitment is the modern-day "it's not you, it's me," and it's up to you to figure out whether or not you can deal with that. The first step is identifying if it truly is a fear of commitment. Here are a few signs:</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>1. They are unable to be vulnerable in the relationship.</strong>&nbsp;They are so afraid of being hurt that they are unwilling or unable to let their guard down to let you in to see the softer side of them.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>2. They are afraid of rejection.</strong>&nbsp;Often times, they won't even admit it to themselves, but they are terrified of being rejected. They are easily hurt and take things personally, adding to that fear.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>3. They are flaky.&nbsp;</strong>They have trouble making plans. This can range from being noncommittal about the next date, a future vacation, or plans to do a milestone event like meeting the parents. Commitment-phobes will avoid these types of plans at all costs. They tend to be unreliable about anything that requires commitment and accountability, even a phone call.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>4. Their relationships never go past a certain point</strong>. They have a long history of brief relationships lasting anywhere from weeks to about 18 months. Nothing seems to break the two-year barrier. When things in a relationship get real, they are likely to bolt.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>5. They have a history of picking inappropriate or unavailable partners</strong>. They have a history of picking people who are not suitable long-term partners — addicts,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>alcoholics</a>, people with unresolved mental health issues, married people, and emotionally unavailable ones. This helps them to avoid having to commit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>6. They have never been married.</strong>&nbsp;Occasionally, you may encounter someone who was married but then got so scared by the pain of their divorce that they became commitment-phobic. Typically, though, they are unlikely to have been married since marriage is the ultimate commitment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>7. They do not have a lot of friends.&nbsp;</strong>Fear of rejection extends beyond romantic relationships. Friendship requires a type of commitment, openness, and willingness to be vulnerable in order to have long-term friendships.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>8. They have trouble using titles.&nbsp;</strong>They are uncomfortable labeling your relationship and using words like boyfriend and girlfriend. They will avoid these terms and discussions about how to handle them.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-where-fear-of-commitment-comes-from></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Where Fear of Commitment Comes From</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The inability to move a healthy relationship forward and commit is a sign of emotional issues. Typically, this comes from childhood, but sometimes from more recent rejection or hurt. Some of the most common reasons that people develop commitment phobia are as follows.</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><li>Seeing parents in a bad relationship</li><li>Experiencing a parent's volatile divorce</li><li>Losing a parent to illness or death during childhood</li><li>Having early childhood attachment issues</li><li>Being subjected to childhood trauma or abuse</li><li>Going through their own bad breakup or divorce</li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-can-a-commitment-phobe-change></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Can a Commitment-Phobe Change?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If someone who has a fear of commitment wants to change, it is very possible. However, oftentimes, their fear holds them back from wanting something different or being willing to do the work to change their mindset. The most effective approach is individual and/or&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>couples therapy</a>. This can help you both figure out if this is something that your partner wants to work through and is capable of doing.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-final-takeaway></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Final Takeaway</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When you have a partner with these fears, you have to take things very slowly, which requires a lot of patience. Typically, the commitment-oriented partner hits a point in the relationship where their resentment and frustration start to do harm to the relationship. Once you get into that territory, the relationship is on thin ice.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In my clinical experience, once those resentments hit a boiling point and things do not change, the relationship is likely to end.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xZ6Yq2Wfm3qku8ymoK2llaPBboGScGlubGA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./im-happier-than-ever-at-49-heres-how.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>I'm happier than ever at 49 - here's how</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./love-actually-inspired-gift-guide.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>11 Love Actually-inspired gifts that fans will adore this Christmas</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./french-montanas-solid-wallet-explains-why-he-aint-worried-bout-nothin.html>French Montanas solid wallet explains why he Aint Worried Bout Nothin Tue 5 July 2022</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-jackson-new-album-songs-for-mother-daughters.html>Alan Jackson's New Album Features Songs for His Late Mother, More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-f1cf0f18-55b5-552e-a3b7-517c726ba35c-html.html>Eagles C Jason Kelce retires after 13 seasons | National</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65b82c73268e3ecb698b458b-html.html>Resultados Progol 2213: premios y quiniela ganadora del fin de semana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-cbd-products.html>What Is It, Is It Legal, And Will It Get You High?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib.
