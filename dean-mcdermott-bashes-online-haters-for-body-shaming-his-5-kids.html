It all kicked off when the 52-year-old’s wife,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Tori Spelling</strong></a>, shared a photo on her <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> of their five kids:&nbsp;Liam, 11, Stella, 10, Hattie, 7, Finn, 6, and Beau, 22 months, at a screening for the movie&nbsp;A Dog’s Way Home. The snapshot also included&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Beverly Hills 90210</a> alum&nbsp;<strong>Ian Ziering </strong>with his wife, Erin, and their two kids, Mia, 7, and Penna, 5. Tori, 45, captioned the pic, “I can’t believe&nbsp;@ianziering&nbsp;and I once played BH teens Steve Sanders and Donna Martin and now we are married to the loves of our lives and between us have seven kiddos who all adore each other!”</p><p>The photo’s comments section, which should have been filled with kind words and lovely messages, quickly turned ugly as online haters started asking, “Why do you let your kids get so fat?” Another person harshly wrote that the McDermott kids looked “terrible” in the pic. But after seeing the mean comments, Dean rushed to his family’s rescue.</p><p>“I am absolutely horrified and disgusted by the comments being left about my children,” the Canadian-American actor commented on Tori’s Instagram post. “Body-shaming and bullying my children??!! What is wrong with you people??!! For your information, we went from a long day at school to the movie. And I don’t know any child that is NOT disheveled at the end of the day. Not to mention that just before this picture was taken, they were wrestling and running around with all the other kids that were at the movie.”</p><p>The Open Range&nbsp;star continued, “So I apologize we didn’t get the iron and steamer out to make them perfect for you. Their [sic] kids. They’re messy and dirty. That’s what they do.” He added, “And what’s wrong with shopping at Target??!! Over half of America shops there. The way they grow out of clothing so quickly is astounding. Are we supposed to shop at Gucci?? These are kids folks. Messy, stinky, little bundles of fun, laughter and love.”</p><p>But Dean was not done there, as he added, “They’re going through different growth phases, and even if our children are on the bigger side, who cares. They’re happy and healthy and I’m sorry they don’t look like skinny supermodels. People come in all shapes and sizes. So who are you to judge? You should all be ashamed of yourselves for passing such horrible judgment on innocent beautiful children. Shame on you all!!!!”</p><p>He wrapped it all up with this: “Thank you to all the people who came to our defense. You’re all kind compassionate souls. Down with the haters!! Up with love!!” Well, it is certainly nice to see a father come to the aid of his kids, although <a href=# rel=noopener>Tori did the exact thing</a> back in September of 2018. In fact, it was over the same issue: people calling out her children.</p><p>“I am a proud mama bear and I enjoy sharing our family journey with my family, friends, fans and online supportive and loyal community,” she wrote on Instagram at the time. “For all the individuals on here that felt the need to #momshame and #kidshame me and my children, I say, ‘Shame on you!’ I was raised to believe that if you can’t say anything nice about someone then don’t say anything at all.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46dnJqmXaKwpbHRpqatrF2XrrS0xKxkqKacnrumeceaq56qo2KzsL6Mm6adsV2otaK5yKeeZqCZqHp2ecqim6xn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dropdav-access-dropbox-webdav.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Get Access To Your Dropbox Via WebDAV</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./a-smooth-mortgage-renewal-process.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>A Smooth Mortgage Renewal Process in 2024| The Enterprise World</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./french-montanas-solid-wallet-explains-why-he-aint-worried-bout-nothin.html>French Montanas solid wallet explains why he Aint Worried Bout Nothin Tue 5 July 2022</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-jackson-new-album-songs-for-mother-daughters.html>Alan Jackson's New Album Features Songs for His Late Mother, More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-f1cf0f18-55b5-552e-a3b7-517c726ba35c-html.html>Eagles C Jason Kelce retires after 13 seasons | National</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65b82c73268e3ecb698b458b-html.html>Resultados Progol 2213: premios y quiniela ganadora del fin de semana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-cbd-products.html>What Is It, Is It Legal, And Will It Get You High?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib.
