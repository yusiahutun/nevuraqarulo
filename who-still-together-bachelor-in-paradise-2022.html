Johnny and Victoria are both original contestants on Bachelor in Paradise season 8. Victoria also confirmed that she and Johnny ended up together when she accidentally posted an Instagram Story in August 2022 of her and Johnny at the grocery store.</p><p>Reality Steve confirmed on his podcast in October 2022 that Johnny and Victoria broke up around early September 2022. The report came after rumors Victoria cheated on Johnny with Greg Grippo, a contestant on The Bachelorette season 17 with Katie Thurston. Reality Steve reported at the time that he also heard the rumors from several sources, but couldn’t confirm if they were true. “I’m not saying it’s not true, I’m just saying I don’t know,” he said. The rumors also came after a TikTok user named Anna posted a video of what looked like Victoria and Greg together in Rome, Italy. “When you are at the Colosseum [and] see Greg Grippo & Victoria F from bachelor nation,” Anna wrote on the video. The video was posted around the time Johnny posted an Instagram Story that he was in Miami, Florida. “Unwell,” he wrote on a photo of him drinking. <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">YouTube</a> creator Dave Neal also shared a photo on his channel at time of what fans believed to be Victoria and Greg walking together in Rome. Reality Steve addressed the picture in his podcast. “As for the picture in Italy, I’m not convinced that that is Victoria, I’m not convinced that is Greg, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t,” he said. ” … If we find out that wasn’t Greg and Victoria in Italy, that doesn’t mean the first two things aren’t true, which are, Victoria and Johnny are done, and Victoria and Greg have something going on. Talking, dating, hooking up, whatever. Did she cheat on Johnny with Greg? I don’t know.”</p><p>He continued, “We’re going to find out what happens at that taping, I’m sure.

The answer is no. Genevieve Parisi (The Bachelor season 26, Clayton Echard) and Aaron Clancy (The Bachelorette season 17, Katie Thurston & Bachelor in Paradise season 7) make it to the final six couples on Bachelor in Paradise season 8 but broke up before the finale, according to Reality Steve. Genevieve was one of the original contestants on Bachelor in Paradise season 8, while Aaron arrived after the first Rose Ceremony. Aaron broke up with Genevieve before “Fantasy Suites” because of how often she would try to leave if they got in a fight, according to Reality Steve. Genevieve and Aaron confirmed during the “After the Final Rose” special they’re not back together and are still broken up, but they’re&nbsp;on good terms now.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Reality Steve</a> also reported in November 2022 that Aaron had a new girlfriend after his breakup with Genevieve. The woman, who Reality Steve didn’t identify because she’s not in Bachelor Nation, confirmed the relationship on her Instagram Stories at the time by posting a vase of flowers she received from Aaron for her birthday and tagging him. She also posted a series of photos from her birthday part with Aaron and other Bachelor in Paradise season 8 contestants including Logan Palmer and Jacob Rapini. One of the photos also showed Aaron and the woman kissing. Reality Steve also reported that the woman knew Aaron before Bachelor in Paradise season 8 given a photo she posted with him in her Instagram highlights around the time Aaron would have finished filming Bachelor in Paradise. She also posted a photo with him in Tulum, Mexico, from January 2022, six months before Bachelor in Paradise season 8 started filming in June 2022. Reality Steve theorized that Aaron’s relationship with the woman explained his behavior with Genevieve toward the end of their relationship.</p><p>“Aaron is no different than a lot of the guys in this franchise. Plenty of them go on the main show and BIP with women back home that are basically put on ‘hold’&nbsp; or they have in the back of their minds if things don’t work out,” Reality Steve wrote. “And knowing that he was with her last summer, then right after filming, and is currently with her, I don’t think it’s far fetched that Aaron probably was talking/hooking up with her pre-BIP filming. How they defined their relationship is beyond me. And to me, my opinion is that I think it explains a lot of his behavior with Genevieve that we’re seeing play out on the episodes now. It just seems like he was using Genevieve for roses, went down to BIP for fun, hang with James, gain some followers, be on TV, and just was never interested in being serious with Genevieve. Kind of explains hit hot and cold behavior with her.” He continued, “One minute he’s telling her he’s not just falling in love with her, but that he IS in love with her. Then a day later he’s fighting with her again. It just screams to me he knew he had someone back home and was just doing whatever he could to stay on the beach as long as he could.”</p><p>After Reality Steve’s post about Aaron’s girlfriend, he reported that another woman contacted him claiming that she was also dating Aaron before Bachelor in Paradise season 8. The second woman also told Reality Steve that she contacted the first woman and learned they were both dating Aaron at the same time, though Reality Steve reported that the first woman is still with Aaron. The second woman claimed that she and Aaron started dating in September 2021, around the time Bachelor in Paradise season 7 (Aaron’s first season) was airing. They dated from September to November 2021 before breaking up. They got back together in January 2022 and started dating again more seriously until May 2022, around the time Aaron left to film Bachelor in Paradise season 8. The second woman also revealed that she knew of the first woman, but had been told by Aaron that the first woman was just a friend. (The second woman claimed that Aaron was telling the first woman the same thing about her.) The women learned Aaron was dating them both while he was filing Bachelor in Paradise season 8. The second woman also shared direct messages between her and the first woman when they learned about Aaron.

He thinks you’re crazy, so stop,” she said.

Clayton’s season hadn’t even aired yet, so I didn’t know who she was. She knew who I was from Paradise and came up to me to introduce herself. We hugged and that was pretty much the extent of it.

The answer is no Jacob Rapini (The Bachelorette season 19, Gabby Windey and Rachel Recchia) and Jill Chin (The Bachelor season 26, Clayton Echard) broke up on Bachelor in Paradise season 8 when Jacob chose Kate Gallivan (The Bachelor season 26, Clayton Echard) over Jill after the “Casa Amor” twist, which caused Jill to self-eliminate. Jacob was later eliminated when Kate chose Logan Palmer (The Bachelorette season 19, Gabby Windey and Rachel Recchia) over him.</p><p>Jacob and Jill got back together at the “After the Final Rose” special in November 2022 after Jacob asked Jill if she wanted to date again and she told him yes. Jill confirmed on the “Click Bait” podcast in December 2022 that she and Jacob split one week after the Bachelor in Paradise “After the Final Rose” special aired. “After our one-on-one aired, we were like, ‘Oh, we’re catching the feelings again!’ And then we started talking more and more,” she said. “And then about three weeks before the reunion, we decided that we probably wanted to give this a shot, so we were just going to talk and try it out.” She continued of their breakup, “I had to do what was best for myself. And there’s just a line and, like, standards that you have for yourself that you just can’t allow people to cross. I don’t have any ill will. I don’t wish bad things. I think I will leave it at — the trust had been broken. And that in a long-distance relationship, you need communication and trust, and we had neither of those things.”</p><p>Jacob confirmed the breakup in an Instagram post at the time. “You were the right person at the wrong time. You gave 100% while I gave 80. You pushed me to look for quality work, change my schedule, and focus on my family instead of hollow relationships. You asked for better communication while I was lacking. You showed up when I didn’t. Trust was lost,” he wrote. “Yes, distance was a big factor for me. Being 2,000 miles away comes with its share of challenges but that wasn’t the main reason. It was readiness of commitment. I appreciate you making me recognize this at the cost of you trying to make it work.” He continued, “We had talked before the reunion and we were both open to giving it a go. At the reunion, I wanted to show you a glorious moment to somehow undo the pain I caused in Mexico. But it isn’t about the big moments. It’s about the little things. I wasn’t there to give you my whole heart because of my insecurities. I have a lot of refinement to do before I can mentally and spiritually be there. You deserve to be loved. Right now, I deserve to be alone Jill, good luck on your journey angel🖤”</p><p>Jill hinted she and Jacob were still on good terms after their breakup on Bachelor in Paradise when she posted an <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Instagram photo</a> with him in October 2022 with the caption: “I’ve always been Team Edward but tonight I’m #TeamJacob 🌕🐺.” Jacob posted the same photo on his <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Instagram</a> with the caption: “Two Leo’s meet in Paradise.

(Season 1 was filmed at the Casa Palapa resort in Tulum, Quintana Roo, Mexico.) According to the hotel’s website, Playa Escondida is a secluded, beachfront resort surrounded by hills, a 350-foot coastline and covered with jungle. The resort is located 40 minutes from the Puerto Vallarta International Airport on the Pacific Coast of Nayarit, known as Riviera Nayarit, and is one mile from the town of Sayulita.</p><p>The resort offers horseback riding on the beach, yoga, surfing lessons, paddle boarding, whale and dolphin watching, hiking and bike trails, and golf.

The Bachelor in Paradise season 8&nbsp;host is Jesse Palmer, who was the season 5 Bachelor in 2004 and was the youngest Bachelor in Bachelor Nation history at 24 years old. Jesse hosted his first Bachelor franchise show in 2022 with The Bachelor season 26 with Clayton Echard. During The Bachelor season 5 finale, Jesse gave his Final Rose to Jessica Bowlin, but didn’t propose to her. Jesse and Jessica continued to date, but ended their relationship a few weeks after the finale of their Bachelor season aired. In June 2020, Jesse and his girlfriend, Emely Fardo, married in an intimate wedding in New York City. Jesse told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Us Weekly</a> in November 2021 that he and Emely planned to marry in Provence, France, before the current health crisis cancelled their wedding date. “We had originally planned a wedding in Provence, France, for summer 2020, which was postponed until summer of 2021 due to the pandemic, but we didn’t want to wait any longer,” he said at the time. “So, we had a small, private and intimate ceremony with close friends who lived in New York City.”</p><p>Jesse graduated from the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where he played football for the Florida Gators, in 2001 with a bachelor’s of arts degree in political science and a bachelor’s of science degree in marketing. After graduation, Jesse was drafted by the National Football League to play for the New York Giants. He played with the team for four seasons from 2001 to 2005 as a quarterback. After the New York Giants, Jesse was drafted by the Canadian Football League to play for the Montreal Alouettes. He played with the team until 2005 when he was signed by the San Francisco 49ers. He then resigned with the Montreal Alouettes in 2006 before he retired from football in 2007 to pursue a broadcasting career. Since his broadcasting career started, Jesse has worked with networks like Fox, NFL Network, ESPN, ABC and SEC Network. He’s also guest starred on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit and made guest appearances on shows like Recipe to Riches and Good Morning America, and hosted the Food Network’s Spring Baking Championship and Holiday Baking Championship.</p><p>Jesse was announced as The Bachelor season 26 host in September 2021. “For more than 20 years, The Bachelor has brought the world dozens of unforgettable love stories, including at one time, my own,” he said at the time. “Falling in love is one of life’s greatest gifts, and I am humbled by the opportunity to return to the show as host this season to offer the newest Bachelor advice gained from firsthand experience and I am grateful to play a small part in his journey.” The announcement came after Chris Harrison, the former host of Bachelor Nation, confirmed in June 2021 that he had retired as the franchise’s host after 19 years. “I’ve had a truly incredible run as host of The Bachelor franchise and now I’m excited to start a new chapter,” he wrote in an Instagram post at the time. “I’m so grateful to Bachelor Nation for all of the memories we’ve made together. While my two-decade journey is wrapping up, the friendships I’ve made will last a lifetime.”</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Deadline</a> reported at the time that Chris received a mid-range, eight-figure settlement as part of exit plan with ABC, the network that airs the Bachelor franchise, and Warner Bros. Television, the company that produces the Bachelor shows. The magazine also reported that Harrison’s settlement included a nondisclosure agreement. Chris’ decision to retire as Bachelor Nation’s host came after he was slammed for&nbsp;his response to season 25 Bachelor contestant <a href=# rel=noopener>Rachael Kirkconnell’s racism</a> scandal in February 2021. <a href=# rel=noopener>Rachael</a>, the <a href=# rel=noopener>winner of Matt James’ season</a>, faced backlash at the time when photos resurfaced of her at an Old South Antebellum-themed party at Georgia College in 2018. Before the pictures went viral, Rachael was already under controversy after her former high school classmate accused her on TikTok of bullying her and other students for dating Black men. Other TikTok users then exposed Rachael for liking social media photos of her friends in culturally insensitive costumes and with Confederate flags.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Chris came under controversy</a> after he was interviewed about the scandal by season 13 Bachelorette Rachel Lindsay on Extra. During the interview, Chris asked fans to give Rachael “grace” and explained that he didn’t find the Antebellum party photos offensive because they just looked like pictures a college student takes at a party. Harrison also questioned whether the photos would be considered racially insensitive in 2018 when they were taken. After the interview, many fans slammed Harrison and accused him of excusing Rachael’s behavior.</p><p>ABC confirmed in March 2021 that Chris wouldn’t host season 17 of The Bachelorette and would be replaced by Tayshia and Kaitlyn. “Chris Harrison will not be hosting the next season of The Bachelorette,” ABC said in a statement at the time. “We support Chris in the work that he is committed to doing. In his absence, former Bachelorettes Tayshia Adams and Kaitlyn Bristowe will support the new Bachelorette through next season. As we continue the dialogue around achieving greater equity and inclusion within The Bachelor franchise, we are dedicated to improving the BIPOC representation of our crew, including among the executive producer ranks. These are important steps in effecting fundamental change so that our franchise is a celebration of love that is reflective of our world.” He officially retired as the Bachelor Nation’s host in June 2021.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Wells-Adams-Bachelor-in-Paradise.jpg><p>Who is the Bachelor in Paradise bartender? The Bachelor in Paradise season 8 bartender is Wells Adams, who was a contestant on The Bachelorette season 12 with JoJo Fletcher and Bachelor in Paradise season 3. Wells has been the bartender on Bachelor in Paradise since season 4. Wells was also a guest host for Bachelor in Paradise in season 7 after ABC fired Chris Harrison as the host of the Bachelor franchise following his controversial comments about The Bachelor season 25 contestant Rachael Kirkconnell’s racism scandal in February 2021. Bachelor in Paradise season 7 featured several celebrity guest hosts including David Spade, Lance Bass, Lil Jon and Tituss Burgess. “I’m not really qualified to be a bartender, and like, I’m okay at that and I’m not qualified to give people advice, I’m not a therapist, but I was a radio host for 15 years, so it was the only thing I was qualified to go do,” Wells told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">ABC 7 Chicago</a> in 2021. He continued, “If I’m being honest, I was kind of [hosting] that the entire season. Let’s be fair, these big shot Hollywood-types would come in with their A/C trailers and say a couple of things and then I’d be up at 4:30 in the morning hosting the rose ceremony. I was glad I finally got my shot in there!”</p><p>In August 2022, Wells married actress Sarah Hyland after five years of dating. They got engaged in July 2019 and were set to marry on August 8, 2020, but had to postpone their wedding due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In an interview on Jimmy Kimmel Live! in 2019, Sarah revealed that she met Wells on Twitter. “Have you seen those memes of ‘Slide into the DMs?’ That. He slid into my DMs,” Sarah said. “I was following him. We had tweeted each other because I thought he was funny and he was a fan of the show. I saw him as the bartender and I was like, ‘That’s really cute.’” She continued, “I was single, obviously, and was like, ‘This is really awesome. You’re being very forward and it’s sexy and not aggressive but very confident and sexy,’ and I liked that.” After some messages back and forth, Wells asked Sarah on a date. “‘Next time I’m in LA, I’m taking you out for drinks and tacos.’” he messaged. Sarah continued, “I love tacos. He loves tacos so that was his thing. Like, ‘I love tacos, let’s see if she loves tacos.’ We both love tacos! We have an obsession with tacos. Tacos and tequila, that’s our thing.”</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Cosmopolitan</a> in 2020, Sarah revealed when she knew Wells was The One. Sarah explained that, a few days after she and Wells had the first real date at an Emmys party in 2017, she underwent her second kidney transplant. Wells flew from Nashville to Los Angeles to see Sarah on the weekends of her recovery process, where he also met her parents. A month into their relationship, they told each other they were falling in love. “I asked him when he was going to ask me to be his girlfriend,” she said. “I’m impatient.” She continued, “We were talking about what kinds of weddings we wanted four days after we made things official. I hate that typical cliché of ‘when you know, you know,’ but it’s so fucking true. At least it was for me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Zach-The-Bachelor-2023-8.jpg><p>Who is the next Bachelor for 2023 after Bachelor in Paradise season 8 ends?

Zach played Collegiate Division 1 football for Cal Poly for five years.</p><p>“My role consists of strategically helping business in Houston enhance, extend, and leverage their current software, platform, and infrastructure while educating them on what Oracle’s portfolio has to offer,” Zach’s Linkedin bio reads.</p><p>Before Zach was confirmed as the season 27 Bachelor, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Reality Steve</a> reported on his podcast in September 2022 that Nate Mitchell, a contestant on The Bachelorette season 19 with Gabby Windey and Rachel Recchia, was offered the role but declined. “In regards to the Bachelor, obviously we’re about three weeks away from any announcement being made, I’m assuming it’s going to be made on the After the Final Rose, if not, within a day or two of that on GMA like they usually do. But after poking around a little bit, asking around, what I can tell you is: I don’t know who the Bachelor’s going to be, but you can cross Nate off the list. I have heard it is not him,” Reality Steve said. “I usually can’t get any details to stuff like that. I have heard, I have no idea if it’s true or not, but I have heard he rejected it, he doesn’t want to do it.” A source also told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">E! News</a> in August 2022 that Nate was the frontrunner to become the next Bachelor.</p><p>The reports also came after Nate was photographed holding hands with a woman at a grocery store in Chicago, Illinois, in August 2022, weeks after he cried over his breakup with Gabby on The Bachelorette season 19 “Men Tell All” special. “Spotted Nate and another girl in Chicago today,” an anonymous source sent to the Instagram account @bachelorettewindmill <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">along with a photo</a>. “They were both holding hands so could be dating?”</p><p><strong>WARNING: SPOILER</strong>. Other season 19 Bachelorette contestants not in the running to be the Bachelor 2023 were: Tyler Norris (who ended up with season 25 Bachelor contestant Brittany Galvin on Bachelor in Paradise season 8) and Johnny DePhilippo (who got engaged to season 24 Bachelor contestant Victoria Fuller on Bachelor in Paradise season 8). Erich Schwer, who got engaged to Gabby in The Bachelorette season 19 finale, and Tino Franco, who got engaged to Rachel, also weren’t in the running to be the Bachelor 2023. <span>Reality Steve also didn’t believe that Logan Palmer, Ethan Kang, Spencer Swies, Aven Jones or Jason Alabaster from </span>The Bachelorette<span> season 19 would be the next Bachelor. According to Reality Steve, the one contestant from Gabby and Rachel’s </span>Bachelorette<span> season he did believe had a chance was Zach. “It means we’re moving on to somebody else. I don’t know who from this season outside of maybe Zach. I don’t see it being Aven. I don’t see it being Logan. I don’t see it being Ethan. I don’t see it being Spencer. I don’t see it being Jason,” Reality Steve said.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Other Bachelor Nation alums who weren’t in the running to be the next Bachelor were The Bachelorette season 17 contestant Michael Allio (who ended up with season 21 Bachelor contestant Danielle Maltby on Bachelor in Paradise season 8) and The Bachelorette season 18 contestant Brandon Jones (who ended up with season 26 Bachelor contestant Serene Russell on Bachelor in Paradise season 8.)</p><p>While Nate wasn’t the Bachelor 2023, Gabby told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Entertainment Tonight</a> in August 2022 that he was her number-one choice as the next lead. “Nate. 100 percent Nate, Nate, Nate!” she said. “He knows how to treat women. He’s so smart, he’s old, he has a great job, he spends his time reading—not reading social media, reading actual books. He has a daughter, so he knows what it’s like to have responsibility. He’s a real, true definition of a man.”</p><p>Rachel told Entertainment Tonight that her choices for the next Bachelor were Nate and Tyler. “From Gabby’s side I would say Nate, [he’s] incredible, and from my side, maybe Tyler. Who knows?” Rachel said. “They really couldn’t go wrong.” Mario Vassall, another contestant from The Bachelorette season 19, agreed with Rachel’s picks. “Nate, his name comes to mind… Nate is a fun, standup guy,” he said. “… I’m a big fan of Tyler Norris. We saw his breakup with Rachel. That was tough to watch. [I’m a] big fan of him, his character. He wears his heart of his sleeve. I wouldn’t be mad if he took that position.” Mario also confirmed that he was open to becoming the next Bachelor in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">E! News</a>. “I would say that I am open to the conversation,” he said.”Ad we’d go from there.”</p><p>Tyler, for his part, confirmed to Entertainment Tonight that he wasn’t interested in becoming the season 27 Bachelor but would root for Nate if he became the next lead. “I couldn’t even imagine dating two women at the same time, let alone 30-something women, but then again, you can’t take anything out of the card,” he said. “My man, Nate, he’s the sweetest, most genuine guy. I would love to see him. He brings flair too… My man would do a great job.” Tyler also told E! News about his concerns over becoming the next Bachelor. “I would definitely say that it’s very hard to navigate,” Tyler said. “With 30-something women there, it would definitely be a tough job to have, without hurting somebody at the end of the day. [But] if it gets me a stop closer to ultimately finding love then absolutely I would do it.”</p><p>Host Jesse Palmer also voted for Nate.&nbsp;“Nate is a standup guy. He’s an amazing person. He’s mature, he has an incredible emotional maturity, he’s vulnerable, he respects women, and he’s a great dad,” Jesse said. “I there’s there’s very few negative things I can say about Nate.” Jesse also had another choice for the next lead. “Are we still saying Pete Davidson? Is that still a choice?” Jesse said. “… I wanna ride that train. Wanna talk about a wild Bachelor season? That would probably be it. We might have to change some of our parameters.”</p><p>Gabby and Rachel also voiced their support for two Bachelors like how there were two Bachelorettes on season 19. “We loved each other for it, and loved having one another by one another’s side,” Gabby said of her relationship with Rachel. “I don’t know if men would feel the same, it depends on their relationship, but I think there’s a lot of good to come out of our season.” Rachel added, “I think ultimately if the Bachelors supported each other and loved each other to the extent that Gabby and I do, it could be incredible as well, but they would definitely have to be on the same level as us. Lots to live up to, of course!”</p><p>Mario, however, was against the idea and told Entertainment Tonight that ABC should “absolutely not” have two Bachelors. Tyler also agreed with him. “I think watching back the two Bachelorette thing was a lot,” Tyler said. “Having two Bachelors would be the same thing. I think they should stick to one.”</p><p><i>Bachelor in Paradise </i>airs on Mondays and Tuesdays at 8 p.m. on ABC and is available to stream on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Hulu</a>.
