The monarch is holding Prince Louis, who was just a few months old, with his siblings, Prince George, and Princess Charlotte, standing on either side of their great-grandmother.

The idyllic and picturesque gardens have provided a wonderful place in particular for the royal children. Here, a young Prince Charles dips his hands into one of the fountains as his beloved grandmother, the Queen Mother, looks on with his aunt, Princess Margaret, who was then celebrating her 21st birthday.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7652001613b6-young-charles-at-balmoral.jpg><h2>The Queen and Prince Philip's growing family</h2><p id=eMb9g3dYWw data-wc=48>The Queen and Prince Philip enjoyed spending time at <a class=hm-link href=#>Balmoral</a> as a growing family over the years.

It's no wonder, therefore, that when she holidays on the Scottish estate, a trip to the stables is always on the itinerary. This picture shows the Queen and Prince Philip's playful side as they visit a farm on the estate. The couple were that year (1972) celebrating their silver wedding anniversary.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/95aeb57ba624-queen-and-philip-with-horse-balmoral-z.jpg><h2>The Queen with a young Prince Charles and Princess Anne</h2><p id=esxjWKnkwJ data-wc=59>As a mother of two, Balmoral afforded the Queen a place to spend quality time with her young children.

The estate held a special place in Queen Victoria's heart and she often spent time there with her family, in particular after the death of Prince Albert in 1861. In this fascinating image from 1867, Queen Victoria stands outside the castle with her dog 'Sharp'.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b7ecbba0874c-queen-victoria-at-balmoral.jpg><h2>Prince Philip with sons Prince Edward and Prince Andrew</h2><p id=e0g-CmmboQ data-wc=50>Prince Philip is seen sharing a joke with his sons, Prince Edward and Prince Andrew, at an event in Balmoral, Scotland as guards and members of the public look on.
