In the new show, both Shardlake and his partner Jack Barak (Anthony Boyle) are often filmed riding across dramatic scenery as they go about Cromwell's business.&nbsp;</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Shardlake first look</figure><p id=e5NipcyRls8 data-wc=68>Arthur had never ridden properly before, so immediately started taking lessons as soon as he knew he'd got the role. &nbsp;He got the hang of things quickly: "I got better as we went through. My horse was a bit of a prima donna actually, a bit difficult. I think he'd been background before, so he'd been used to being on a set, but now he was the lead."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c6f842628939-shardlakefirstlook.jpg><p id=eaK2ZxGaalR data-wc=68>The cast and crew were filming on a long stretch of beach that was littered with boulders which made the horses nervous. Arthur recalled: "We were trotting along, and then it bolted and jumped over this bush and we were barrelling towards the crew. He stopped just in time, but it was a bit of a hairy moment. It was really [expletive] scary." Thankfully, no one was injured.&nbsp;</p><p id=eK_yapPD6jz data-wc=9><a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>READ: Arthur Hughes reveals scoliosis prosthesis worn on Shardlake</a></p><p id=ePjyAYqWAqz data-wc=56>Arthur was involved in another physically testing scene when his character falls into a bog. To create the scene, the crew had to find the wettest patch of land possible and dug out a section, filling it with water for Arthur to 'fall' into: "That's my favourite scene," Anthony told HELLO! "Arthur stuck in a bog."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/93190a7bb6af-screenshot-2024-04-12-at-112330.png><p id=eZq5G34Himw data-wc=47>"The bog was quite a fun day because we could only do one or two takes of me falling in because the costume would just get completely ruined. They actually built a dry bog in the next field where I could pretend to be stuck," remembered Arthur.&nbsp;</p><p id=emFJgKuC-uf data-wc=57>Anthony's least favourite scene to film also involved water: "You're getting naked and you're jumping into the pool and it's freezing. Even though the pool was like a jacuzzi, you've got to jump out and get your hair warmed again and heated into a quiff and then jump in again. So there's a bit of that repetition."&nbsp;</p><p id=e8Zc3v8EOiO data-wc=37>The inhospitable castles were cold, many of them elevated: "There wasn't really anywhere to get warm, so you were just wet and freezing for the rest of the day. But you can't complain. It's a blessed life."&nbsp;</p><p id=eM6hvgh10-b data-wc=7><strong>Shardlake is available to stream on Disney+.&nbsp;</strong></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
