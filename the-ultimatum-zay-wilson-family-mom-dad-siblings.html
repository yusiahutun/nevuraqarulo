This article focuses on one of the casts of Zay Wilson’s family. Learn more about his mom, dad, and siblings in this article.</p><h3><strong>The Ultimatum: Meet Zay Wilson Family</strong></h3><p>For two and a half years, Zay Wilson and Rae Williams dated. Zay, on the other hand, received an ultimatum from his girlfriend, who stated that she wanted to establish a life with him that she had always imagined. Zay, on the other hand, doesn’t appear to be quite ready for it yet.</p><p>He was convinced that neither of them was prepared. He made it evident that they were not just financially insecure, but that Rae had difficulty expressing her feelings in favor of his position. Later, Zay said that he saw a future with the woman he’d been with throughout college, hinting that it was only the chronology and obstacles they’d faced that had prevented him from saying so, and that’s why they signed up for the program.</p><p>Zay and Rae looked to enter the controlled dating scene after their split. While Zay struck up a conversation with Shanique Imari, Rae struck up a conversation with Jake Cunningham. Because of the (wonderful) way things were going with these new connections, they felt jealous, guilty, and even sad at times.</p><p>Now we’ve covered his journey <a href=#>here</a>.</p><p>Keep scrolling down to learn more about Zay’s family.</p><h3><strong>Who Is The Ultimatum Zay Wilson Dad?</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gossipnextdoor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/The-Ultimatum-Zay-Wilson-Father-300x298.jpg><p>Unlike his fellow casts, The Ultimatum‘s Zay Wilson has remained quiet about his father. His father hasn’t appeared on his social media accounts. But, his sister has featured his father on her Instagram a few times, particularly on her graduation. Based on the posts, his father is married to Zay’s stepmother.</p><p>Zay’s sister hasn’t shared the names of her father and stepmother. She, however in one post, had mentioned that her father is a pastor.</p><h3><strong>Who Is The Ultimatum Zay Wilson Mom?</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gossipnextdoor.com/wp-content/plugins/trx_addons/components/lazy-load/images/placeholder.png><p>Like his father, the same situation also applies to his mother. She was also present at Zay’s sister’s college graduation. She attended her graduation with her husband, who is Jay’s step-father. And as already stated, we have no information on her marriage or information regarding their relationship.</p><p>On 1 May 2014, Zay’s sister wished their mother a birthday which is the only information we have related to her.</p><h3><strong>Does The Ultimatum Zay Wilson Have Siblings?</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Zay Wilson has at least five siblings and half-siblings. He has three older <a href=#>sisters</a> including Shawnae Johnson (<a href=#>@justshawnae</a>) and Chevonne Jordan (<a href=#>@they_call_me_ms.cali</a>).

Whereas Chevonne turned 32 years old in August 2021.</p><p>According to Chevonne’s bio, she is a “Mommy to Mikayla, Maleah, Cordae and Bonus Mommy to Jayven & Braylen”.

She is married and tied the knots in June 2020.</p><p>It appears that Shawnae couldn’t be more proud of Zay for doing the Netflix show. She has been posting about the show a few times on her IG and telling followers to watch the show.</p><p>Besides Shanae, Zay also has a <a href=#>younger brother</a> who is 28 years old as of 2022.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Does Zay Wilson Family Live?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Zay Wilson’s Family might be living in different parts of Texas.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Does Zay Wilson Family Appear On Instagram?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>No, Zay Wilson’s family hasn’t appeared on Instagram.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>What Is Zay Wilson Family Ethnicity?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Zay Wilson is of African-American ethnicity.
