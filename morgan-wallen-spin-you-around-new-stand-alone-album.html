Other titles include "Sleep When We're Dead" and "Yin Yang Girl." There's a country-rock vibe to the project, but&nbsp;it's not missing the hip-hop influence he'd become known for.</p><p>Paul Trust and Sergio Sanchez (singer of the rock band Atom Smash) are Wallen's co-writers on all 13 of these songs. While not as powerful as the music he'd record a few years later, fans will recognize the beat of new songs like "Going Down" and languid melody on tracks like "Scared&nbsp;to Live Without You."</p><p>In 2014, Wallen competed on Season 6 of <a href=#>The Voice</a>, so&nbsp;the songwriting session that led to these songs would have likely been right after — 18-24 months before he'd sign with Big Loud Records. He doesn't deny recording for Panacea and signing an artist management deal.</p><p>"Unfortunately, I signed both deals without any legal representation,"&nbsp;Wallen&nbsp;explains.</p><p>"2 of Us Alone" is an example of a song worth regretting. A flaccid arrangement accompanies a vocalist that's barely recognizable in 2024.</p><p>Piano and acoustic guitar accompany Wallen on "Afterglow," a song seemingly targeting the early-2000s soft rock audience. Elsewhere, "Man of the South" and "Bonfire Jam" chase a commercial rock crowd; producer Trust is not likely to get new work in Nashville should he decide to lead with this batch of songs.</p><h3>Listen to Morgan Wallen, "Spin You Around":</h3><p>Wallen&nbsp;wants fans to know that the newly-released album is not his next project, although he&nbsp;tells fans that he'll return to the studio to record in February.</p><p>"I cringe when I listen to&nbsp;these songs," he says.</p><p>Joey Moi led production of this new acoustic — and approved — version of "Spin You Around," and Wallen says he cut it in Nashville this week (he also designed the song's cover art).</p><p>To pay it forward, he's decided to donate $100,000 from the Morgan Wallen Foundation to the Volunteer Lawyers & Professionals for the Arts program to help young musicians that may find themselves in similar positions.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>20 Best Morgan Wallen Songs — Hits Every Fan Should Know by Heart</h2>You'll find largely singles in this Top 20 countdown of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Morgan Wallen</a>'s best songs and biggest hits.
