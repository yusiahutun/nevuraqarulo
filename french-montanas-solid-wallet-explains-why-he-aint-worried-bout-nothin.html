This is according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Celebrity Net Worth</a>. His worth soared after signing a record deal with Bad Boy Records and Maybach Music in 2012.</p><p>However, his career initially started in 2002, when he released mixtapes under record label Cocaine City.

DJ Duffey revealed to Fomo Blog that she met him in Miami when actor Justin Combs introduced them, far before any of his break-out records were released. She said:</p><p>I watched him perform in a club in Miami, I’m like, ‘He has something special.’ That’s another reason why I started deejaying. I have an ear for talent and I didn’t even know it. At the time,&nbsp;I was more of just a fan. Every time he was in Texas or in the Texas area, I literally would go support him. If I’m anywhere he was, I’d always support his music. We became friends and developed a really good brother-sister friendship. Now to be working for him is amazing.</p><p>She even twerked at French’s set at Coachella! DJ Duffey spoke of the moment and added:</p><p>For him to let me have my moment in the show and stand up on a DJ booth, be sexy, do my thing, and get the attention from the crowd, it’s special.</p><p>Once, DJ Duffey and French jumped off the tallest building in Australia together!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>If I was Duffey I wouldn’t give up that French Montana bag cause I know it’s a nice one <a href=#>#bbwla</a> <a href=#>#basketballwives</a></p>— Nyyyy (@Naiiyaaaa__) <a href=#>May 31, 2022</a></figure>View Tweet<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-dj-duffey-s-fortune>DJ Duffey’s fortune</h2><p>DJ Duffey has a net worth of $1 million, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow>Popular Net Worth</a>.
