Adapted from Lisa Genova's bestselling book, the tender and occasionally harrowing drama tells the story of a Columbia University linguistics professor who discovers that she has early onset Alzheimer's.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"What was so compelling about the script was that it was the first time I had seen a disease like this depicted objectively. It's usually from the point of view of the caregiver or a family member who's watching someone transform in this way. This brings you inside this character and her journey through it," Moore says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The actress told co-directors and writers Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland at the start that she didn't want to represent anything on screen that she hadn't actually seen. Whether it's using a highlighter so as not to lose your place in the middle of a speech or self-administering a daily memory test on your iPhone, everything that Alice does in the movie is based on reality.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"I felt like that was the only fair way to do it," she says. She immersed herself in the world of Alzheimer's through books and documentaries that she, Glatzer and Westmoreland would pass around to one another, but also by talking to clinicians, neurologists and patients.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Moore started at the national level, conducting Skype calls with patients the Alzheimer's Association put her in touch with. She had a doctor administer an extensive cognitive test on her at New York's Mount Sinai Hospital. She consulted with gerontologists.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">During her sojourns to long-term care facilities and support groups, Moore found herself struck by the generosity of everyone she spoke to in the process and observed that people's personalities were very evident, no matter how advanced their disease.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"There was a guy who was really gregarious and would talk to everybody and welcome people as you walked through. He had owned a bar. And another woman was a model who had worked in fashion, she showed me her book. Another woman had been a designer. It was just interesting," says Moore.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On set, Moore saw an immediate example of the effects of a disease on a marriage. Glatzer, who is married to Westmoreland, is living with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease). By the time production started on the movie, he'd lost his speech and the use of his arms. In an interview, Glatzer communicated by typing on an iPad with a toe on his right foot.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"I could still type with one finger on the iPad," Glatzer says. "It's so very important if you're struggling with a disease like this to feel you still matter. It's ironic that in my deteriorated state, I'd be able to make a film that was creatively everything I'd ever wished for."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Although ALS is quite different from Alzheimer's - Glatzer has all of his cognitive faculties - both are degenerative diseases. "I think they put a lot of their own experience into this," Moore says of 's writer-directors. "This is a movie about living with disease, not succumbing to it."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To illustrate Alice's deterioration across the story's two-and-a-half- year period, the directors used various tricks including make-up and camera filters, while Moore took pains to subtly alter her speech and physicality.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"We never wanted you to know that there was a certain change in Alice's character till the end of the movie when there's a comparison with who she used to be through discovering a video message. Then you suddenly are slammed with how much she's changed. The changes happen subtly and incrementally, but, you know, inevitably," Westmoreland says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Moore was surprised that the most difficult and tiring days were those where her character was most declined. "Those were the days when I had fewer lines. But it was about the effort that people are making to go through the disease."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The winner of this year's best-actress Golden Globe, Moore is a favourite to win the Academy Award come February 22. She's not shy about admitting how great it would be to win. "Ultimately, it's about your peers recognising your work. Who doesn't want that?"</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Still Alice</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZK6zwNJmmq6kpKq%2FpnvAq6uim5yafHKCmG5taW5fn8KttcCnpZ5lnaS8s7GMsJ%2BarF2irqyx0maYpbKYmrausdGsZKanpp6ybr%2FToqOlZZGhtqSxjKym</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kewanee-mayor-memories-now-up-in-smoke-after-kewanee-boiler-fire.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kewanee mayor: Memories now up in smoke after Kewanee Boiler fire</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./fifa-17-toty-fut-ultimate-16969806.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>FIFA 17 TOTY Defenders and Goalkeeper LIVE for FUT Ultimate Team on PS4, Xbox One and PC</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./french-montanas-solid-wallet-explains-why-he-aint-worried-bout-nothin.html>French Montanas solid wallet explains why he Aint Worried Bout Nothin Tue 5 July 2022</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-jackson-new-album-songs-for-mother-daughters.html>Alan Jackson's New Album Features Songs for His Late Mother, More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-f1cf0f18-55b5-552e-a3b7-517c726ba35c-html.html>Eagles C Jason Kelce retires after 13 seasons | National</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65b82c73268e3ecb698b458b-html.html>Resultados Progol 2213: premios y quiniela ganadora del fin de semana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-cbd-products.html>What Is It, Is It Legal, And Will It Get You High?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib.
