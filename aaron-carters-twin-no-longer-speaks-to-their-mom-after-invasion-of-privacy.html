He wrote: “Selling my 2nd home. Real estate has been super good to me. Ready for a new chapter in my 3rd home which I plan on staying to make a beautiful life for my family.”</p><p>The 34-year-old’s 4,131 square foot home, where he died, <a href=#>was sold</a> for a whopping $749,000 (£599k) to a family who lived in Huntington Beach, California. They reportedly made an all-cash offer for the seven-bedroom and four-bathroom mansion, which also has a hot tub and swimming pool outside.</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Fairytale of New York singer Shane MacGowan dies after hospital update</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpqX2WEcK3Aq6anZZOWv7Wx0axkra%2BZo3qvu4ylpqeflad6tLzEmqKsZaSkerW0xKKpZqWfonqistOeqWahnquutLXOp2Sonl2lv6rCwJywaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./china-housing-boom-may-have-hit-potentially-precarious-peak.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>China housing boom may have hit potentially precarious peak, a Harvard-Tsinghua working paper</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tyga-accused-trying-sidestep-2-million-judgment-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tyga accused of trying to sidestep $2 million judgment</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./french-montanas-solid-wallet-explains-why-he-aint-worried-bout-nothin.html>French Montanas solid wallet explains why he Aint Worried Bout Nothin Tue 5 July 2022</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-jackson-new-album-songs-for-mother-daughters.html>Alan Jackson's New Album Features Songs for His Late Mother, More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-f1cf0f18-55b5-552e-a3b7-517c726ba35c-html.html>Eagles C Jason Kelce retires after 13 seasons | National</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65b82c73268e3ecb698b458b-html.html>Resultados Progol 2213: premios y quiniela ganadora del fin de semana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-cbd-products.html>What Is It, Is It Legal, And Will It Get You High?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib.
