However, sometime soon after passing the big four-oh landmark, I began noticing that the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>skin on some areas of my body</a> was starting to look, well, crepey. After trying a few products that aided in hydrating my skin but <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>did little to smooth it</a>, in September I received an invitation to a roundtable discussion about one of the latest additions to the SkinMedica line, the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Firm and Tone Lotion</a>, an anti-aging body treatment to correct this very issue. Ever since I first started using the pricey treatment, I have felt more comfortable in my skin.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While many other companies promise results, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>SkinMedica is one of the few I really trust</a>. Why? Not only was the brand founded by renowned dermatologist Dr. Richard Fitzpatrick in 1999 as a scientifically-based skincare line, but its parent company is <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>Allergan</a>, the pharmaceutical powerhouse behind Botox and CoolSculpting. While other brands spend a good portion of their budget on advertising, SkinMedica invests in skin biology through preclinical studies.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I started using the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Firm and Tone treatment</a> in September on my arms and thighs, the two areas where my skin sags the most. I applied the lotion, which glides on very easily and dissolves quickly, twice daily. I love the smell, which is light but citrusy. I experienced zero irritation and my skin felt quite hydrated, even after using the product for a day. Almost immediately I started noticing a difference, and after just four weeks of use on my arms, the crepiness was much less pronounced. Because thigh skin is thicker, it took a little longer to notice the smoothing effect, but after 12 weeks the tightening effect is evident.&nbsp; After four-plus months I can honestly say that the lotion works wonders and lives up to its $165 price tag.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now:</strong> $149 (Originally $165); <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">amazon.com</a> or $165; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">dermstore.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dermatologist and associate clinical professor at Yale School of Medicine, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Mona Gohara</a>, MD, explains to InStyle that body skin aging begins as early as 25 and continues to thin as you get older. As the skin becomes thinner and sags, it starts to get that crepey look. She recommends the SkinMedica lotion to her clients as both a standalone and supplemental treatment for those who undergo body contouring treatments, including CoolSculpting and Cooltone. “It is clinically proven to diminish the look of crepey skin, address uneven skin texture, improve the appearance of body skin firmness and tone, and improve the look of sagging skin,” she says.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Gohora breaks down the nourishing formula, which includes green microalgae and shitake mushroom extracts to “support extracellular matrix proteins, including collagen and elastin,” coffee arabica seed oil, which enhances “skin elasticity and firmness by supporting collagen levels,” caffeine, to help smooth and rejuvenate skin, and hydrolyzed rice protein, which “helps detoxify stressed skin,” she says.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The product is relatively new, so shopper reviews are just starting to trickle in. One <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Amazon reviewer</a> in her seventies claims that after using the product for just two weeks, the crepey skin on her arms and stomach was “almost entirely gone.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Clearly the biggest con about this product is the price, but from my many years as a beauty editor, I have come to the conclusion that generally, most effective treatments aren’t cheap. My advice? Invest in the SkinMedica <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Firm and Tone treatment</a> — you won’t regret it.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK570qSgp6WVmbakrYyfoKulXZa7pXnTqKWeZZKksbp5y6iroqeeYr%2BmwsiermZvYG6DdIWU</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tommy-shaw-and-jeanne-shaw.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tommy Shaw and Jeanne Shaw</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./taiwanese-pop-star-jay-chou-latest-celebrity-issue-ntfs-selling.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Taiwanese pop star Jay Chou latest celebrity to issue NFTs, selling 10,000 digital bears desig</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./french-montanas-solid-wallet-explains-why-he-aint-worried-bout-nothin.html>French Montanas solid wallet explains why he Aint Worried Bout Nothin Tue 5 July 2022</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-jackson-new-album-songs-for-mother-daughters.html>Alan Jackson's New Album Features Songs for His Late Mother, More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-f1cf0f18-55b5-552e-a3b7-517c726ba35c-html.html>Eagles C Jason Kelce retires after 13 seasons | National</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65b82c73268e3ecb698b458b-html.html>Resultados Progol 2213: premios y quiniela ganadora del fin de semana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-cbd-products.html>What Is It, Is It Legal, And Will It Get You High?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib.
