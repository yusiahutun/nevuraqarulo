The American fashion designer and self-described "geriatric starlet" was known for her distinctive, joyful approach to dressing, was a regular on the front rows at Fashion Week, and worked with the likes of Estée Lauder and Greta Garbo during her career. In tribute, we revisit an essay Apfel wrote for Bazaar in 2020, in which she affirms her philosophy that "fashion should always be fun".</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="body-dropcap css-803sjt emevuu60">I’ve loved fashion ever since I was a little girl. I always liked dressing up, and my mother was very chic. She was at home with me until I was about 11, when she went back to work, leaving me to fend for myself. I recall one occasion when Easter was coming and I didn’t have an outfit to wear for the big parade on Fifth Avenue. It was the height of the Great Depression and my mother was too busy getting her business established to take me shopping, so instead she said, “I’ll give you 25 dollars”, which was a generous amount of money at that time, “and you can go into the city and get yourself an outfit – it’ll be good experience.”</p><img alt="iris apfel" title="iris apfel" width=2836 height=2127 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/iris-apfel-1631281390.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Iris Apfel</span></p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for When Bazaar met Iris Apfel" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/brightcove/57504a16e694aa51138d8c6e/thumb_1464879649.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I was crazy with joy and went straight to S Klein, the granddaddy of all discount shops on 14th Street in Manhattan, because I knew I’d get a good bargain there. Right away, I found a dress I thought I simply had to buy – but then I remembered my mother telling me I must never buy the first thing I saw, I must comparison-shop. So I went uptown and looked around the big department stores – Macy’s, Lord & Taylor, Best & Company – where naturally everything was much more expensive. I decided I’d better go back and get that dress, but when I got there, I found it gone! I was frantic and breathlessly looked through all the racks, found it, gave thanks to God and 12 dollars and 98 cents to the cashier. I put that dress in my hot little hands and went on to accessorise my prize. I bought myself some beautiful leather shoes for three dollars and 98 cents, a pretty straw bonnet, a pair of gloves, and I still had enough change to take the subway home to Queens. My family was overjoyed: my mother praised my taste; my father said I was economically sound. Only my grandfather, who was an old-world master tailor, found fault with the buttonholes. But then again, he could never find a buttonhole to satisfy him.</p><img alt="iris apfel" title="Iris Apfel" width=2985 height=2064 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/iris-vintage-2985x2064-1595418647.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Iris Apfel</span><p>Iris Apfel as a young woman</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For me, jewellery is the most transformative part of a woman’s wardrobe – it can change the look of a whole outfit. You can take the same outfit right through from morning to cocktails simply by re-accessorising. I especially love costume jewellery, because I think the artists who make it are freer in their approach. I’ve been collecting pieces since I was 11 years old, and I still have the first one I ever owned. I bought it from a shop in the basement of a tenement building in Greenwich Village – it was filled with all kinds of junk, but I mentally transformed it into Aladdin’s cave. The store was owned by an elegant elderly gentleman who had fallen on hard times. While the cuffs on his suit were frayed, he always wore a boutonnière, a monocle and spats. He was fascinated with me, as he had never seen a kid so interested in his junk. Upon arrival, he would kiss my hand and treat me like a mini duchess… I was smitten. There was this one brooch I went cuckoo about, with pretty pieces of glass inside that I imagined were rose-cut diamonds. I was very fanciful back then. He gave me a price that was way over what I could afford, but I saved my pennies and once I had what I thought was a respectable sum, I went back to bargain with him. We haggled and haggled, and he eventually let me have it for 65 cents. I treasure it to this day.</p><img alt="iris apfel" title="iris apfel" width=3648 height=4644 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/20210723-iris-apfel-0240-1647952700.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Richard Phibbs</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Anxious to break into editorial fashion, I took a post at Women’s Wear Daily in New York – the lowest possible job you could get. Now everything’s electronic, but at the time publishers would hire copy boys and girls to take pages from one editor to the next. I was constantly walking back and forth around this rambling building for the magnificent sum of 15 dollars a week. The only good thing about that job was that it saved me having to go to the gym! Still, I loved magazines. Harper’s Bazaar and Vogue were my bibles – I couldn’t wait for the next issue to come out, and I’d read each one from cover to cover.</p><img alt="iris apfel with her late husband carl" title="Iris Apfel with her late husband Carl" width=600 height=598 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/26tmag-apfel-slide-xtk6-articlelarge-8-1595418673.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Iris Apfel</span><p>Iris Apfel with her late husband Carl</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I think it’s very funny that I’m considered a style icon nowadays. My husband [Carl Apfel, who died in 2015] and I used to laugh about the whole thing, because I’m not doing anything I wasn’t doing 70 years ago – it just seems to have finally caught on. I always like to dress in my own way; I’m not like everybody else. I find a lot of people say they want to be individual, but they’re just paying lip service. I often say, “It’s better to be happy than well dressed”, by which I mean it’s wonderful to look good, but if it becomes a chore and makes you nervous and uncomfortable, it isn’t worth it. Life is very grey and the world is not the kindest place, so I think fashion should always be fun. Over the past decade or two, I’ve tried to help people understand that. Some of them have written to tell me I’ve given them courage and joy, and some have even said I’ve changed their lives. I’m grateful for that.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"My philosophy is to live in the now – yesterday is gone, you don’t know if there’s even going to be a tomorrow"<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I’ve been quarantined for more than three months now. I don’t bore myself, though – I enjoy my own company, and really, the lockdown has been a blessing in disguise, because I’d been working like a fiend and it has been 10 years since I had a vacation. I’m not a spring chicken any more so I was very tired, and I’ve had a wonderful enforced rest. My apartment’s right on the water in Palm Beach and I consider myself fortunate that I can sit out on my terrace every day.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I always like to make people happy, especially at a time like this, and I have a lot of fun with my <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.instagram.com/iris.apfel data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Instagram feed" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Instagram feed</a>.

As my husband used to say, you should really live every day as if it were your last, because one day you’ll be right.<br></p><img alt="iris apfel" title="iris apfel" width=2602 height=3648 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/20210723-iris-apfel-0768-1647952809.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Richard Phibbs</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As told to Frances Hedges</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwssCsn6KnnmSzor%2FHoqanZZ6axLR7wGxqbHFgZYR4e8iroKxlkaWzpriMpaCfnV2ewG7CxKuwZp%2BimsZuv85mnZqrmJ68r3nSoaaupJRirq3DwLKqZpqVYrO2uo4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./motorcyclist-killed-in-clinton-county-single-vehicle-crash.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Motorcyclist killed in Clinton County single-vehicle crash</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kesha-ortega-actress-age-height-weight-biography-videos-boyfriend-wikipedia-and-more.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kesha Ortega (Actress) Age, Height, Weight, Biography, Videos, Boyfriend, Wikipedia and More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./french-montanas-solid-wallet-explains-why-he-aint-worried-bout-nothin.html>French Montanas solid wallet explains why he Aint Worried Bout Nothin Tue 5 July 2022</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-jackson-new-album-songs-for-mother-daughters.html>Alan Jackson's New Album Features Songs for His Late Mother, More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-f1cf0f18-55b5-552e-a3b7-517c726ba35c-html.html>Eagles C Jason Kelce retires after 13 seasons | National</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65b82c73268e3ecb698b458b-html.html>Resultados Progol 2213: premios y quiniela ganadora del fin de semana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-cbd-products.html>What Is It, Is It Legal, And Will It Get You High?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib.
