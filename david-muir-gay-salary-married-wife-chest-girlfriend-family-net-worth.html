It is believed that Muir inspired former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to apologize to the Americans for using a private email server.</p><p>Notwithstanding the above ABC credited him with several exclusive interviews he conducted that made the headlines around the world. For example, Muir was the first to interview President <a href=#>Donald Trump</a> after his inauguration.

The two were often spotted together and shared pictures on social media which led fans to believe that they had more than a platonic relationship – especially considering Gio is openly gay. Whether or not there was anything romantic going on between them remains unknown but it’s clear that the two have an incredibly strong bond!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/David-Relationships.jpg><p>David and Gio have been close friends for many years but neither of them ever addressed the rumors that they were romantically involved. Thankfully all those rumors can now be put to rest; on 17th September 2015, Gio got <a href=#>engaged to his boyfriend</a> Tommy DiDario.</p><p>The two had a beautiful ceremony in Miami and are happily married now! It’s so great to see these two get their happy ending together – congratulations David and Gio!</p><p>It was a pleasant surprise to hear that Kate Dries and David were an item! On 10th September of the same year, Kate declared their relationship in a light-hearted article titled Report Indicates My Boyfriend David Is a ‘Monster’. It’s so nice to read about how they first met and all the romantic moments they shared during their courtship. We wish them both all the best for their future together!</p><p>It looks like the relationship between Muir and Kate is a bit of a mystery. After Kate mentioned that she was his girlfriend they have not been linked together since then. Neither of them has commented on the situation so it’s unclear if they broke up or if it was just an innocent joke. Whatever happened between them fans hope that both parties are doing well and wish them all the best in their respective paths!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=is-kate-dries-married-to-david-muir><strong>Is Kate Dries married to David Muir?</strong></h2><p>No, the popular journalist and Kate Dries are not married. However, they did make headlines recently when Kate opened up about her date with David in an article titled “Report Indicates My Boyfriend Muir Is a Monster.” The story was accompanied by photos on Kate’s Instagram account which made it even more interesting to read! It seems like these two have quite a history together.</p><p>It seems that the status of Kate and David’s relationship is a bit unclear. They never really discussed it any further and David didn’t confirm if he was dating her or not. This has left people to assume that they were never together or had broken up at some point in time. Whatever the situation maybe we can only hope that both of them are doing well!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=david-and-rebecca-muirs-wedding-relationship-and-family><strong>David and Rebecca Muir’s wedding, relationship, and family</strong></h2><p>It’s no surprise that celebrity siblings often find themselves in the spotlight whether they want it or not.

While some celebrities choose to be open about their romantic involvements others opt for a quieter life away from the public eye – though fans will always try to peek into their lives! In this case, people are curious about David and Rebecca Muir’s love lives which has sparked debates regarding potential weddings between them.</p><p>David and Rebecca Muir are two of the most recognizable names in the United States. David is Rebecca’s younger brother and it was his success as an ABC News network managing editor that made him a household name.

Although the couple has never posted any wedding pictures online before or since their marriage began they remain a happy family regardless!</p><p>The American journalist has had the honor of being included in various photographs from celebrity weddings such as former president George Bush’s daughter’s nuptials!

However, as with all his other rumored relationships or marriages, there isn’t any proof to back up these claims.
