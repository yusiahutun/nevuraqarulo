In the 16 episodes released in season one, protagonist Moon Dong-eun (Song Hye-kyo) summarily wraps up her vengeance against Park Yeon-jin (Lim Ji-yeon) and cronies, leaving virtually no loose ends when it comes to the central revenge plot. However, loose ends abound for Joo Yeo-jeong (Lee Do-hyun), Dong-eun’s plastic-surgeon boyfriend, who is still looking to make his father’s murderer suffer for the torment he’s caused.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf7ic8z3002e3b6vhjhkv0o5@published data-word-count=42>Yeo-jeong’s unfinished revenge under Dong-eun’s tutelage leaves the narrative door open for The Glory to craft more meticulously executed vengeance. Could a second season happen? Should it? And if it does happen, should it center Joo Yeo-jeong or someone else? Let’s discuss.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf7aq043000y3b6v21ufchos@published data-word-count=72><strong>Wait, isn’t there already a second season of The Glory?</strong><br>No, though the confusion is understandable. In an attempt to take a small step away from the binge model, Netflix is increasingly implementing a strategy of splitting up single seasons into two parts (see also the most recent season of <a href=#>You</a>). The Glory season one consists of 16 episodes split into two parts. “Part Two” is the second half of the first season.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf7aq0or00123b6v988wxr31@published data-word-count=64>First, Do-yeong crashes a truck into Jae-jun’s car. Then, in the construction site Jae-jun stumbles into — presumably owned by Do-yeong’s Jaepyeong Construction — he pushes Jae-jun off of a ledge to his death in a cement pool below. Do-yeong’s murder of Jae-jun parallels Yeon-jin’s murder of So-hee years earlier. It also demonstrates just how many people on this show are capable of killing.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf7aq1co00153b6veyip1rgl@published data-word-count=79><strong>What would a second season of The Glory look like?</strong><br>The most obvious story line for a second season would follow Yeo-jeong’s revenge against Kang Yeong-cheon (Lee Mu-saeng), the man who murdered his father. In the final episode of The Glory season one, Dong-eun is convinced not to jump off of a building to her death by Yeo-jeong’s mother, who begs Dong-eun to help her son enact the revenge that consumes him. Dong-eun agrees and sets about planning that revenge.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf7aq1j700163b6v1fw4l7og@published data-word-count=48>The final scene of The Glory shows Dong-eun and Yeo-jeong walking into their jobs at the prison where Yeong-cheon has been transferred, but we don’t know exactly what their revenge will look like. If Netflix and The Glory creators were interested, this plot could sustain a season two.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf7aq1n000173b6v6q50ab6c@published data-word-count=102><strong>Would a story based on Yeo-jeong’s revenge really work thematically?</strong><br>That’s a good question! Honestly, maybe not. As much as I love Yeo-jeong and his Pinterest-worthy camping setup, his revenge isn’t thematically in line with Dong-eun’s. Dong-eun’s mission is so cathartic and relatable because it is a microcosm for the larger inequalities in society. Dong-eun is a kid living in poverty and without powerful parents to ensure she is protected. Her bullies mostly come from rich, well-connected families for whom the system is designed to protect. Because of this, Dong-eun must enact her own revenge, and it takes her decades to do so.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf7aq1vm00183b6vfk43awji@published data-word-count=126>Yeo-jeong’s revenge is not the same. He was born into a rich family with all of the opportunities and comforts Dong-eun never had. The death of his father, a doctor with a kind heart who is killed by one of his patients, is tragic and traumatizing but not driven by systemic injustices. Yeong-cheon, who was already in prison for previous murders, is also prosecuted and sentenced for the murder of Yeo-jeong’s father. It sucks that he appears to feel no remorse for all the murdering he has done and that he seems to enjoy life in prison, but that’s not representative of a systematic failure. Or, if it is, the failure came in not getting Yeong-cheon the mental-health support he so obviously needed earlier in life.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf7aq1yf00193b6vblffg32a@published data-word-count=72><strong>Is there another plot The Glory season two could follow?</strong><br>Why, yes. Yes there is. In The Glory’s first season, Dong-eun apologizes to only one person: Ye-sol, the young daughter of Yeon-jin. Imagine a season two of The Glory that follows a teen or 20-something Ye-sol’s attempted revenge against Dong-eun. This could be a bit tricky, given the necessary time jump, but I’m willing to pretend Song Hye-kyo looks 50 if you are.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf7aq22v001a3b6vuzf4ggg3@published data-word-count=81><strong>That sounds like another story about rich people being rich. Are there any other options?</strong><br>Well spotted. Yeah, a story about Ye-sol’s revenge could hit some of the same thematic snags as a story about Yeo-jeong’s revenge. Alternatively, it could be interesting to see The Glory take on more of an anthology format. If the series went in this direction, season two could center a new character with her own story of injustice and revenge, masterfully penned by hallyu writer-queen <a href=#>Kim Eun-sook</a>.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf7aq28a001b3b6vtog6ko4q@published data-word-count=115><strong>Is there anything that could prevent a second season?</strong><br>Always. There is Netflix’s <a href=#>recent strategy shift</a> to scale back on multiple seasons of seemingly popular series. There are also <a href=#>the allegations</a> that surfaced over the weekend that The Glory’s director, Ahn Gil-ho, was involved in a school-bullying incident in high school. Although Ahn initially denied having any memory of the incident, on Sunday, the legal representation for Ahn <a href=#>released a statement</a> apologizing for the harm he caused. In Korea, these kinds of allegations <a href=#>can end a career</a>. Even if they don’t for Ahn, it would make him directing a second season of The Glory — a story about violent abuses of power — awkward at best.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf7ieikh003a3b6v1ck0xh8i@published data-word-count=88>Furthermore, there’s also the matter of military enlistment for Lee Do-hyun, the actor who plays Yeo-jeong. As every K-drama stan knows, Korea requires all able-bodied men to enlist in the military by age 28. Lee will turn 28 next month, which has prompted <a href=#>unsubstantiated but admittedly educated rumors</a> that he will enlist soon. Once he enlists, he must serve for at least 18 months, which would make filming a second season of The Glory — at least one that includes Yeo-jeong — nearly impossible for almost two years.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf7aq2ch001c3b6vy6cvxix6@published data-word-count=59><strong>Should K-dramas have second seasons?</strong><br>This has been <a href=#>a hot topic</a> in the K-drama community as many fans have enjoyed the one-and-done format that Korean series have traditionally offered. The story format is different (though not inherently better or worse) than the traditional American TV model, where stories can stay open-ended for hundreds of episodes before coming to a conclusion.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf7aq2fi001d3b6vgtggacpz@published data-word-count=81>It would be a shame if K-dramas lost the one-and-done format completely. The Korean TV industry has <a href=#>built its immense contributions to hallyu</a> on emotionally complex storytelling that prioritizes catharsis above plot or even character. The Glory, for example, has some unexpected plot twists, but they never come at the expense of seeing Dong-eun get what she wants after having suffered so much. It would be tricky to try to hold the totality of that cathartic experience past the first season.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clf7aq2lu001e3b6vqhhjjzfg@published data-word-count=61>That being said, the Korean TV industry makes more than 100 dramas every year. While Netflix may be interested in spinning its most successful K-dramas into multiple seasons, distributors like Viki offer a <a href=#>much more extensive catalogue</a> of Korean entertainment options, mostly ones that aren’t affected by the traditional American production and distribution model. Who says we can’t have it all?</p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>How The Glory’s Gruesome Ending Sets Up Possible Season Two</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlpbGdgaHy1tMRmnqWnoq56prrDoqWgZZWtva2tyKecnWWTpMKtsIytn56qlWKvpnnAZqqem5%2BjsW6%2FxJqqqKZencGuuA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./meaning-of-rose-garden-filled-with-thorns.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Meaning of &amp;quot;Rose garden filled with thorns&amp;quot;</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./clint-black-acm-awards-backstage.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Go Backstage at the 2015 ACM Awards With Clint Black</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./french-montanas-solid-wallet-explains-why-he-aint-worried-bout-nothin.html>French Montanas solid wallet explains why he Aint Worried Bout Nothin Tue 5 July 2022</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alan-jackson-new-album-songs-for-mother-daughters.html>Alan Jackson's New Album Features Songs for His Late Mother, More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./article-f1cf0f18-55b5-552e-a3b7-517c726ba35c-html.html>Eagles C Jason Kelce retires after 13 seasons | National</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65b82c73268e3ecb698b458b-html.html>Resultados Progol 2213: premios y quiniela ganadora del fin de semana</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-cbd-products.html>What Is It, Is It Legal, And Will It Get You High?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib.
