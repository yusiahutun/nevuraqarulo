How is his girlfriend now? Is he dating Olivia Kaiser?</p><p>Here is what we know about Horacio. So, keep scrolling down to read all that we know about him.</p><h3><strong>Horacio Gutierrez Girlfriend</strong></h3><p>Horacio Gutierrez has seemingly confirmed that he is in a relationship with fellow The Challenge cast member Nurys Mateo. The 38th season of MTV‚Äôs popular competition series, Ride or Dies, included the now-dating couple as rookie castmates, but they didn‚Äôt engage in a romantic relationship in any of the episodes.</p><p>Horacio and Nury‚Äôs dating rumor began when the latter shared several videos where she gushed over a guy, prompting speculation about who she was referring to. She referred to herself as the ‚Äúluckiest girl‚Äù in one video and described how the unknown man had surprised her with a skydiving date. In another video, she flaunted an Apple Store bag containing a pair of Airpod Max headphones, hinting that a guy had bought her a pair after she stated that she needed new ones.</p><p>After traveling to New York on September 24, the pair showed Horacio her father, elder brother, grandfather, and closest friend. The couple is figuring out their distance relationship. She revealed after five days apart, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just not used to going this long without seeing each other so it‚Äôs definitely hard right now.‚Äù</p><p>Then, it appears like Nurys and Horacio are officially dating outside of the show because they have shared similar posts on social media.</p><p>Superfan account @thechallenge_news released an Instagram Story clip of Nurys kissing an unidentified male off-screen on Saturday night. Although the man‚Äôs face is only seen from the side, he is sporting sunglasses and has bangs that hang over his forehead. It‚Äôs not clear enough to identify who it is, but it might be Horacio.</p><p>Horacio is pictured with his Ride or Dies cast mates at the reunion on the third slide down. Among them are Jay Starrett, Olivia Kaiser, and Nurys, who leans her head against Horacio‚Äôs shoulder.</p><p>Nurys left room for interpretation and speculation when she first published the Instagram Story with the mysterious man. Horacio reposted the Instagram Story video of Nurys‚Äô kiss on his account. He also included a graphic of two hands creating a heart and the words ‚ÄúLife lately‚Äù in cursive writing in the corner.</p><p>Nurys, who was born on 13 February 1995, turned 28 years old in 2023. She is a reality star, fitness enthusiast, and C4 Energy Athlete.</p><p>Back in 2022, when he appeared on The Challenge, Horacio was accused by Johnny ‚ÄòBananas‚Äô Devenanzio and Devin Walker of lying about having a girlfriend back home.</p><p>However, his fellow cast member Olivia Kaiser stood up for him clarifying the situation. When the rookie appeared on Derrick Kosinski‚Äôs podcast, The Challenge Mania, she said she was glad for Horacio because it allowed him to come out of his shell. She also explained that he was casually dating someone instead of having a girlfriend. Olivia claimed that he respected both women and that he intended to inform the person back home of the circumstances before pursuing Laurel further.</p><p>While many assumed that he might be Olivia‚Äôs crush no it was Horacio. They are good friends and he also thanked Olivia who he believed to be a better person.</p><h3><strong>How Old Is Horacio Gutierrez?</strong></h3><p>Horacio Gutierrez is 27 as of this writing in October 2023.
